## Who I am?ü§î
Putting in simple words, I'm a Brazilian young man in my late teens who barely speaks english but tries to. A person whose dreams ,which I prefer to call goals, are to participate in a innovation or a discovery of something. Okay, I do dream big, but I will not give up on this no matter what is in front of me. I have started to study programming and IT but don't have much time because i have time issues (college entrance exams).

## Future PlansüòÑ
Nowadays, I'm studying to get into college here (UERJ or UFRJ). When I get in, I will study for both college and IT as much as I can. After that, My final goal (I think) is to be employed by a big company like Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, and so on.My biggest concern is that I don't know for sure what will be my specific area in IT, I'm considering AI's projects or CyberSecurity.
