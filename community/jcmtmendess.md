## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm jcmtmendess, a recent psychology graduate with a passion for exploring the intersection of technology and human behavior. I'm excited to share my story and goals with you, and I hope you'll join me on this journey. ðŸš€

### A Little About Me

I recently graduated in psychology and had the opportunity to work on various academic research projects. I also completed an internship at the Court of Justice, where I worked as a conciliator. This experience not only improved my problem-solving skills but also gave me a deeper understanding of the importance of effective communication and conflict resolution. ðŸ§ 

After completing my internship, I decided to take the leap and move abroad to the UK. This decision allowed me to immerse myself in a new culture, improve my English proficiency, and gain new work and life experiences. During my time in London, I worked as a streamer for a casino, which was an exciting and challenging experience. Although it wasn't directly related to my field of study, it taught me valuable skills such as adaptability, time management, and teamwork. ðŸŽ²

### My Journey with Technology

Although I don't have direct professional experience in the tech field, I've always been fascinated by technology and its potential to transform various aspects of our lives. My first foray into the world of tech was through the Santander Bootcamp 2024, which I was fortunate enough to secure a grant for. I'm currently participating in the bootcamp and learning the fundamentals of programming and software development. ðŸ’»

### My Goals

As I continue to explore the world of technology, I'm drawn to the intersection of psychology and artificial intelligence. I'm particularly interested in the applications of deep learning and ethics in this field. I believe that understanding human behavior and emotions is crucial for developing AI systems that are both effective and responsible. My goal is to contribute to this field and help shape the future of AI in a way that benefits society as a whole. ðŸ¤–
