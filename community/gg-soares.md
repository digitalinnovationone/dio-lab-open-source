## About Me:

I'm Guilherme Soares, 27 years old, transitioning from a six-year career in video production to the tech world, with a strong focus on Artificial Intelligence. My background in videomaking taught me creativity, discipline, and problem-solving ‚Äî skills I'm now applying to the tech field.

Although I started studies in Business Administration and Civil Engineering, they gave me a solid analytical foundation. Currently, I'm learning Python and prompt engineering to explore how AI can drive innovation in business.

Curious and persistent by nature, I dive deep into everything that interests me. Outside work, I stay active through sports and connect with creativity through music ‚Äî I play guitar, drums, and used to be in a locally successful band.

I‚Äôm passionate about sci-fi, biographies, movies, and games, and I‚Äôm looking for opportunities in innovative companies that value growth, learning, and people eager to evolve.
