## Languages and Technologies üñ•Ô∏è
These are the Technologies i'm currently working with and also the ones i plan to incorporate into my stack:

### Current Stack
- **Python**
- **SQL**
- **Java**

### Plan on incorporating:
- **VBA**
- **R**

## What Fires Me Up üî•

- **Data Wrangling**: I love the puzzle of cleaning and organizing messy data. Python and SQL are my trusty tools, and I'm always up for a good data wrangling challenge.

- **Machine Learning**: From predictive models to clustering, I'm diving into the world of machine learning. I'm exploring libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow to bring data to life.

- **Visualizing Insights**: Data tells stories, and I enjoy using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visual narratives that make complex insights easy to grasp.

## Lifelong Learning üìö

I'm a firm believer in continuous learning. Whether it's a new algorithm, a different statistical approach, or a fresh coding technique, I'm excited to expand my skill set and grow as a data scientist.

## Let's Collaborate ü§ù

I'm all about collaboration and teamwork. If you're passionate about data, coding, or anything at the intersection of technology and insights, let's connect! Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/egaldino03)!

## Currently Exploring...
Right now, I'm delving into Pandas and Matplotlib for creating awesome data visualizations capable of making the viewers captivated. Stay tuned for some exciting projects in this space!
