# Erick Leandro!

First of all, I'm passionate about technology and programming. I've done several things in my life like: caboman, videographer, video editor, pamphleteer, stockist, computer technician, but today I consider that I'm doing what I really love, to develop. I am currently a web programmer, working with **JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS,** and **Node technologies**. I also develop for mobile with Flutter and NODEJS for backend.
