# ðŸ‘½ Hello World, I'm Clara!
I'm 19 Years Old, currently graduating in Systems engineering from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), from Belo Horizonte-MG. I'm new in this Technology Scenario, but I'm learning a bit more each day. My interest in programming whas born from game passion, which led me to decide that i want to develop for a living. My hoobies are playing games, especially riot and idie ones, listening to music, watching anime and cartoons and sometimes I draw.
