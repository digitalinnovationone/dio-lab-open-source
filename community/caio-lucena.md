# Hello World!
- I'm Caio Lucena, an enthusiast of almost everything from the geeksphere (from The Elder Scrolls Online to One Piece).
- Right now I'm studying Análise e Desenvolvimento de Sistemas (something like "analisys and systems development") na [Fatec Carapicuíba](http://www.fateccarapicuiba.edu.br/). This is a 3 years course.
- I was blessed with an internship at my first year and now I'm working hard to become a developer someday.
- The first programming language I learned was Java S2
