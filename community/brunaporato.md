üë©‚Äçüíª Hello, I'm Bruna ‚Äì a spirited explorer in the world of front-end development. With over 6 years of experience in graphic design and a degree in psychology, I'm on an exhilarating journey through the evolving landscape of code.

üé® My foray into the digital realm began with graphic design, where I discovered the magic of visual storytelling. From colors that speak emotions to shapes that define identity, I've crafted narratives that go beyond words. Over time, I realized that my creations needed an interactive canvas, and that's when I delved into front-end development.

üèñÔ∏è I'm nestled in the awe-inspiring landscapes of Brazil, where the vibrant culture and the rhythm of life are my muse. Whether I'm sipping coconuts on the beach, analyzing the psyche, or elegantly coding digital experiences, I've found a harmonious balance that fuels my creativity.


<small>nice to meet you üíú</small>
