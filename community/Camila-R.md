## Who am I
Hey, I'm Camila da Rosa. I'm 30 years old.  I’m a bit nerd and I like to travel, enjoy naturem and love animals. Because of that, I've a little dog named Berenice, she's 1 year old. I also hope to have a cat one day. 

## What about me
I’m a proactive person and determined. I’m always looking for professional improvement and, because of that, I'm always studying and learning. I’ve an adventurous spirit and I don't like to be accommodated. I’m not afraid of new challenges and taking risks.

## What about my professional journey
I graduated in 2015 from Law School and worked as a lawyer in Brazil for 2 years, but I wasn't happy. So, I began my search for professional happiness. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to enter the world of technology in 2018, working in customer success. That marked the beginning of my journey. Later, I had the chance to work as a Product Owner, and I can say that I am discovering myself as a professional. Currently, I'm a Senior Field Software Engineer, exploring my role as a developer and actively seeking opportunities in that field.
