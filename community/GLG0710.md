Hello! My name is Gustavo Lima Galdeano, a university student of Computational Science at Universidade Veiga de Almeida. At the moment, I am in the 2nd period of the course, and I have learned web development there. However, I don't limit my studies to the university, so I started studying at home with DIO. Currently, I am studying the basic Java bootcamp.
