### Hello World! ðŸ––

# Eduardo Moraes here:

I'm a Multiplatform Software Development student at Fatec JacareÃ­, currently in the 4th semester, with an expected graduation in December 2025. Throughout my studies, I have been deepening my knowledge in software development across various platforms, focusing on creating innovative and efficient technological solutions. Additionally, I am continuously improving my practical skills through both academic and personal projects.

I have always been passionate about technology and software development, constantly seeking to enhance my skills. I'm excited to find my first professional opportunity where I can apply my knowledge and contribute to impactful projects.

### Who Am I Outside of Coding?

I'm an active person who puts effort into everything I do, always eager to learn new things. My biggest interests include art, games, and, of course, codingâ€”I truly love what I do.
