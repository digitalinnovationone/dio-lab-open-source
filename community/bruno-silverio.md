### About me
I'm a software developer with experience since 2020. I've had the opportunity to create a variety of applications, spanning areas such as event management and vacation property management, among others. Additionally, I enjoyed an enriching stint at an urban mobility startup, Parkeen, where I expanded my skills in mobile and web application development, encompassing front-end, back-end, and database work.

My passion for technology is evident in my pursuit of crafting successful products that efficiently tackle challenges. I am a dedicated team player, focused on delivering results and maximizing profits. I have a solid background in simplifying processes to improve the customer experience.
