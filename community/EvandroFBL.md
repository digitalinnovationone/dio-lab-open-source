## About me

Hi, I'm 33 years old and graduated in Computer Science from the Federal University of Lavras (UFLA). I've been working as a software developer for 6+ years. Currently, I'm working as a TOTVS Protheus developer at Expresso Nepomuceno LTDA. My work uses a very niche programming language called ADVPL (Advanced Protheus Language) and its "evolution" called TLPP (TOTVS Language Plus Plus). They are used to make customizations and new routines for their main ERP software called Protheus, as you might have guessed. So my general workflow is like a full stack developer, I do backend things like modeling data, applying business rules, and then serving in an API or making it available directly in front end, which can be auto-generated or custom-made.

I'm starting a back-end study with Java Spring and frontend in Angular by DIO to expand my backend knowledge to other, less niche, languages.
