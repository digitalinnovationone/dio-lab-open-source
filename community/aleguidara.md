# Hello, I'm Ale Guidara
<table> 
<td valign="center"> 
  Drummer since 1982.
  I graduated as an audio technician in 1997 at IAV - Instituto de Áudio e Vídeo, and worked in rehearsal and recording studios.
  Between 1998 and 2001 I studied music at Faculdade de Música Carlos Gomes.
  But since 2001 I have been working with 3D models for architecture and scenography. In these more than 20 years I have worked on museum projects such as Museu da Língua Portuguesa in São Paulo, Museu das Minas e do Metal in Belo Horizonte, Museu da Gente Sergipana in Sergipe, and others.
  In addition to the scenographic design I also produced content animations and videos for them.
  
  * I'm currently studying *Game engines*.
  * I'm currently learning *Unreal Engine* and interested also in *Godot Engine*.
  * My goal is to learn many tools as possible.
