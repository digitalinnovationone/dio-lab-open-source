# ðŸ‘‹ Hello Devs! Welcome to my Github profile.
## My name is Gelson and my nickname is Junior!

## Introduction
 I am a passionate software developer currently studying Systems Analysis and Development. I am in the process of a career transition, driven by my long-standing love for technology. With a background in business management and experience as a key user in my previous profession, I bring a unique perspective to the tech world. I am highly motivated to build a new chapter as a developer and excited about the journey ahead. LetÂ´s go ahead!!! :smiley:
