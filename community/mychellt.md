### Hello Guys! 👋

- 👨‍💻 My name is Mychell, I'm a Computer Engineer by UFRN and I've worked with technology for 15 years. Java is my principal language which I've used during all 15 years of my career. Otherwise, I've worked as a freelancer as well and used a lot of other languages such as Python, Javascript, kotlin and Go.
