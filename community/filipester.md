# Hey there, I'm filipester ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
My name is AndrÃ© Filipe Obenaus, I'm a Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineer who's diving headfirst into the world of coding. While my background is rooted in engineering, I've developed a real passion for programming and technology. I'm excited to transition into a career in coding and am always on the lookout for new learning opportunities and challenges.

## My Coding Journey
I'm still in the early stages of my programming journey, with skills ranging from beginner to intermediate. Here's what I'm working with:

- **Programming Languages:**
  - **C:** Learning the ropes of writing efficient and effective code.
  - **Python:** Getting the hang of scripting, automation, and some data analysis.
  - **JavaScript:** Exploring how to create dynamic and interactive web experiences.

- **Technologies:**
  - **Node.js:** Starting to build server-side applications and understanding backend development.
  - **Arduino:** Enjoying hands-on projects and prototyping cool hardware ideas.
