Currently graduating in Computer Science at UNESP-Rio Claro. My first contact with programing was during a technological course where i needed to program a character in adobe animate, utilizing javascript. Despite that, during my graduation i studied C, C++, Java and Python, with java being my favorite among the languages learned.
Love arts, technology and culinary, my hobbies are cooking, watching(movies/anime/series) and a little bit of gardening.
