# WALKIRIA SILVA

Hello! I'm an English teacher during the day, but when no one's watching, you'll often find me immersed in the world of technology. I'm relatively new to the tech scene, but I'm a passionate learner, and this journey has been incredibly enjoyable.

My current focus is on Python for Data Analysis. Beyond my tech pursuits, my hobbies include reading, watching movies and series, and indulging in an arguably excessive amount of memes.

Let's connect and learn together as I continue my exciting journey into the tech world!
