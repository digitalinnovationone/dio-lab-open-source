 **ðŸŒ¸ Front-end Dev / Artist / Digital Crafstman**
 <br>
I am an indie front-end dev who is also an artist!
A lot of how I learned how to code was to make applications or websites for my own brand/business (Fraymotiff).
I have a degree in Art Bachelor and am taking classes of the Computer Science degree in the same university I got my first degree (UFRGS) and plan to get in the full course soon.

<summary>ðŸŒ¸ My coding Journey</summary>

### How it all started

I was around 11 years old when I first discovered the world of coding, I wanted to edit and add images to my Neopet's page, so I learned a bit of HTML to do so. Around age 14-15 I discovered tumblr, and i that blogging site, there was the option to edit your own blog theme using Styles, I remember adding autoplayers for muisc, gifs, animations, edit the background and more!
The last thing related to coding I did before I took it more seriously was attempting a Discord bot back in 2018, without any prior knowledge to javascript, it was qyuite the challenge! In the end, I was succesfull! It was an achievement I will never forget.

### Taking the next step
Around 2020 I started a course to become a fullstack developer, it took me a bit to get the hang of coding again , but once I did I started developing my first simple websites, not looking too proffessional, but I was proud of my progress. 
Nowadays I have done another discord bot in honor of the old times, am working on professional websites for my portfolio, and taking classes for C# and racket as well.
