# About Me
Passionate about the intersection of people and technologies, I embarked on a unique path driven by an insatiable curiosity about the world and a love for continuous learning. With degrees in Literature and Pedagogy, I've dedicated the last 15 years to these fields, honing my analytical and procedural thinking.

Fueled by a profound interest in digital products and the exciting prospect of harmonizing creativity with analytical vision, I made the leap into the technology sector. Currently navigating a career transition, my focus is on contributing to the planning and execution of strategic projects.

My perspective is inherently human-centered, with empathy and collaboration shaping my decision-making. My unwavering determination lies in meeting the genuine needs of users and delivering functional results as a direct outcome.
