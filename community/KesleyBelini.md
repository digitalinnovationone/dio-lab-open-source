# Hello! I'm Kesley Belini 👋

**Junior Backend Developer | Java & Spring | Software Engineering Student**

## About Me

I'm a **Junior Backend Developer** and **Software Engineering student**, focused on **Java and the Spring ecosystem**. I’m building a strong foundation in backend development by applying **clean code, SOLID principles, and best practices** in real projects.

I enjoy learning how backend systems work end-to-end — from APIs and databases to containerized environments — and I’m always looking to improve my code quality and technical skills.

Currently, I’m seeking **Junior or Internship opportunities** where I can learn from experienced developers and contribute to production-grade systems.
