I am a first-year Computer Engineering student at University of Campinas (Unicamp) committed to turning complex problems into practical solutions through tech and strategic thinking.

Currently, I serve as a Business Advisor at Conpec, Unicampâ€™s student-run enterprise in software development. In this role, I tackle real-world business challenges and have significantly improved my communication and problem-solving skills. 

My goal is to keep growing both technically and professionally to make meaningful contributions to every project Iâ€™m part of.
