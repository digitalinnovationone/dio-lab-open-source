## 🚀 About Me
I'm a student of Systems Analysis and Development 💻.  

I'm also learning English — according to some tests and the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages), I'm currently at a B1 level. I'm getting better every day!  

I'm a gamer 🎮 and, when I'm not busy with college stuff, I’m the proud father of four cats 😺.
I guess that’s it for now — I’m still getting to know myself.
