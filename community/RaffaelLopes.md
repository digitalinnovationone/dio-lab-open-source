About Me.
"Graduated in Environmental Management and Systems Analysis, with over 12 years of experience in the educational field, focusing on environmental issues. I worked in the 
Chemical Processing and Biotechnological Research Group of Natural Products at the Federal Technological University of Paran√° (2017-2018). Currently, I am transitioning my 
career, seeking opportunities to gain experience in the technology field. 
I value teamwork and actively contribute by collaborating with others and providing assistance in the best possible way. I find great satisfaction in both teaching and 
learning. I am seeking a professional opportunity that allows for my intellectual, professional, and technical growth, enabling me to contribute to the organization for 
a long time as we grow together."
