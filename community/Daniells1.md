<p>My name is Daniel Leite,I am an eletrical engineering student 👨‍🎓⚡ from Recife,Pernambuco - Brazil .That said,one day I realised that just studying hardware 🤖 wasn't enough for me.From that day on, I'm on my journey to become the best developer i can be;and i am doing this by creating my own personal projects and also  helping other people in their own projects.
</p>

<p>Currently my main focus of practice and study is on full-stack Web developtment,nonetheless, i am also interested in data science and data-science and date analystics mainly due to college  and work activities.
</p>

<p>Leaving aside my professional profile,I am  a really  easy going person,a  complete geek , and a total lame when it come to sports in general 😅.

If you're here looking for answers I hope you can find them in one of my repositories.

In case you wan't to contact  me,these are my social medias👇
