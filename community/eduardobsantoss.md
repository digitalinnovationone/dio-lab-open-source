<p align="justify">Engineer in training, currently pursuing my degree in Computer Engineering at IFTM. I have a strong passion for technology, with significant experience in front-end development and UI/UX design, honed during my time at BugWare as Director of Communication. Additionally, I have an extensive background in software development, application design, and technical support.
<br>
 My journey in technology started with curiosity, grew through dedication, and flourished through hands-on experiences, including leading design projects and optimizing interfaces for enhanced user engagement. Beyond coding, I am a dedicated basketball player, having represented my college in tournaments and held a leadership role in the athletic department's marketing efforts.
