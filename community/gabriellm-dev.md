# Hello ðŸ‘‹ WorldðŸŒŽ, I'm Gabriel Lima!

## About me

Hello, I am currently in a career transition, looking to explore an old passion for technology that has not been achieved. For life reasons, we studied accounting, I have analytical skills and the ability to solve problems.

- ðŸ“š I'm currently dedicating myself to learning programming and software development, focusing on Java, Spring Boot, MySql, but that doesn't mean I don't accept other areas.

- ðŸ˜Ž I am a curious, persistent and collaborative person, I work well in a team and I am able to adapt quickly to new challenges and situations.

- ðŸ”­ I'm looking for an opportunity to contribute to the development of technology solutions, whether as an internship, junior or beyond, let's talk.
