Hi! My name's Alessandra da Costa Vieira, and thank you that's reading this file right now (really, I really will be glad if anyone ever read this!). So, first of all, I'm a **full-stack** developer that... Actually dont work with full stack.. YET!

Important note: I'm a trans woman. Yeah it's just it, dont mind, just saying!


## üìö What can I do, actually, no jokes here

Being the most objetive I can: Nothing, but, at the same time, everything. Yeah, I know it's confusing, but that was been told in a "I dont have any experience yet" way, I just know basic stuff about developing at all, but... I'm the most adaptable people that I know in the world (I'm not meaning it on an egocentric way!).

There's my technical skills about what I have worked with:
 - ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)

 - ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)

 - ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white)

 - ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)

 - ![Electron.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Electron-191970?style=for-the-badge&logo=Electron&logoColor=white)

 And, with no experience but a good background study, I want to do future projects using:
 
 - ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)

 - ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)


 Talking in a more subjective ways, I have developed some notable soft skills through my life (I will justify all of them in some sort of "about my dreams" section later), but, I will sadly say that I dont have beautiful badges like the ones above to talk about it, so I will just list it here:

- Leadership
- Charisma
- Project Organization
- People Management
- High Adaptability
- Ease of realizing my own mistakes

## ‚òÅ So... About me and my dreams

Let's get the boring topics away, talking about me, my name is Alessandra, I am an 18 years old trans woman who lives in Pelotas (I really hate this city btw), Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil and wants to be **the** Full-Stack developer. I am studying everyday, doing my best and being the best I can :)

That dream come out when I was little, in the final years of my elementary school I was interested into this, so I have been studying since this time, but with a childish vision of everything, I never studyied the basis (Just last year, when I really wrote down that I will be a Full-Stack Developer), so, since then, I am performing my best!

About the soft skills I have talked earlier, I have developed them into my High School projects. I was Vice Class Representative, as well as a dance teacher from a club that I have opened with a friend (we two have done a lot of boring bureaucratic stuff). I was treasurer of my school student union too, so I have took a lot of these in here!

## ‚Åâ About me **right now**

Nowadays, I am studying computer science on Universidade Federal de Pelotas (UfPel), while I am doing a lot of academic projects, trying to make a good networking basis.

I have some plans wrote down, like... I want to live on Canada or New York City, but I am really far from this yet, so my first objective here is to move into Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul capital. With this, I want to contact bigger companies and expand even more my networking.

Thank you for reading my presentation!
