### Hi, I am Gustavo!

As a web developer with over 10 years of experience, I have had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects, from responsive sites to complex logistics operation software. My main focus has always been on delivering high-quality products that add real value to the customer.

Throughout my career, I have developed a deep understanding of web development best practices and have a track record of delivering solutions with the right balance between efficiency and code quality. I am proficient in several tools such as PHP, Laravel, Vue.js, PostGreSQL, and MySQL, and I have experience in developing custom solutions for various industries, including the pharmaceutical, finance, and health information industries.

In addition, I have extensive experience working with agile methodologies, with over 6 years of experience delivering successful projects using Scrum and other agile frameworks. I believe that working collaboratively with the team and the client is key to delivering high-quality products that meet their needs and exceed their expectations.

If you are looking for a skilled and experienced web developer who can help your company build high-quality products, I would love to hear more about your needs and discuss how I can contribute to your team.
