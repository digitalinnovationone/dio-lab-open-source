## A Little Bit About Me
I am an enthusiast of technology, communication and everything related to data.
I designed myself professionally in media analysis and planning, an advanced environment in the Advertising and Marketing sector, which aims to extract the maximum amount of marketing information, through research (consumer market, audience on TV, radio and internet), to give advertisers the best experience when looking for a communications professional/company.
15 years of experience in media analysis, with extensive training in the exact field, starting in mechanical engineering, going through a specialization in project management and continuing with the systems analysis and development course.
In the humanities area, I have training in advertising and law, the latter specializing in the digital field (General Data Protection Law).
Of all my achievements, I highlight some brands that I had the pleasure of guiding their planning, such as ArcelorMittal, Unimed Vit√≥ria, Hortifruti, Banestes, SEFAZ, Autoglass, Politintas, Rede Gazeta, among others, which passed through my hands with different types of campaigns advertising companies, and who achieved their objectives through work focused on return on investment, continuous improvement of visibility processes, reach of target audiences, and other metrics available in the media departments in which I was based.
My motivation comes from the possibility of using my skills and competencies to expand and exceed the expectations of those around me, be they clients, my peers, or my superiors, correlated with my personal and professional development.
