## Projects

I'm passionate about coding and enjoy working on various projects. Here is the first one:

1. [Hello-World](https://github.com/johnnyssauro/hello-world): My first contact with the Github site and done the most iconic aspect for a programmer.
2. [MyFirstPage](https://github.com/johnnyssauro/.vscode): My first project, project created by me that uses CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to create a web page that serves as a link shortener.
3. [DIO community](https://github.com/johnnyssauro/dio-lab-open-source): This is an open source project that i participated and learned how to use git and github commands to make a markdown page as readme for github.

Make sure to check out these projects to get a glimpse of my coding skills and interests.
