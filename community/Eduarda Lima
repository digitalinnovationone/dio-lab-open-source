## SOBRE MIM
My name is Eduarda, I am 19 years old, and I’m a student of Systems Analysis and Development.
I love learning more and more about the world of technology. Currently, I’m deciding which area I want to pursue. 
It took me some time to understand and learn about the IT field, since I didn’t have the opportunity to be in close contact with it before. 
Even now, I keep striving to learn more and more. But one thing is certain: I truly love it.
