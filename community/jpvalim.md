# Jefferson Valim

Hi I'm Jeff 👍!
Running on to get a developer job.


## 🚀 About me

I've started and found out about DIO on 2022 since there I've participated of two bootcamps, to update my knowledge on programming.

On family issues and work issues I spend a time studing java to find a job on programming.

I hope this bootcamp can help me.

You can find out more about me on my linkedin.
