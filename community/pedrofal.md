I am an aspiring front-end React JS developer on a quest for my first professional opportunity. Beyond my coding skills, I bring a diverse range of talents that fuel my creativity and sense of aesthetics. Having a film degree with focus in photography and post production image, I possess a unique perspective that allows me to create clean, captivating interfaces. Besides that, the experience in the film industry taught me the appreciation for the power of collaboration, I have worked in crews with more than 100 persons, in different departments, having to interact and communicate assertively to solve any problem fast and with precision. I enjoy to be in team environments, adapting swiftly and contributing to collective growth. Through my passion for music theory, I have acquired a mathematical logical mindset, enabling me to think critically, find pattern and solve coding puzzles with the logical mindset required.
