**ABOUT ME**
### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Felipe Vieira

I'm an enthusiastic beginner developer with a passion for bringing ideas to life through code. Currently, my main focus is diving deep into **Python**, exploring its versatility and building foundational skills. I'm always eager to learn and improve my programming abilities ðŸ’»âœ¨.
