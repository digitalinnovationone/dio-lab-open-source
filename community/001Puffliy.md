### Hello, i'am Mariana, i love cute things, and i always try to put a bit of that into my personal projects. 💕
The first programming language I had contact with was javascript in 2020, from that first contact I started to get interested in programming, but I only started to really study at the end of 2023. I'm currently looking to delve deeper into Front-End, but I'm always up for new challenges!
