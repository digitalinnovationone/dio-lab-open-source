Hello 🖖 this is Memoria

### Data Science student
--------------------------

For the past eight years, I’ve been relentlessly honing my coding skills, a journey that began when I decided to pivot my career. My initial foray into the realm of coding involved mastering Python, a powerful language widely used in data science. I also delved into R, another language favored by data scientists for statistical analysis. Over time, I’ve developed proficiency in SQL for database management and have gained experience with AWS for cloud-based solutions.

My mission is to architect compelling data-driven applications that address real-world challenges.
