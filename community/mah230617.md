A description about who I am and my knowledges

Hi there! My name is MaÃ­ra, and I am a programming student. I have no previous experiences, but I am a very curious person. Since I was little, I used to play games in computer, before even Windows exists. I studied Computers Network in college, now I'm intending to go deeper and learn more abour programming. I'm currently studying HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Tailwind, JavaScript, more Front-End Stuff, but I wanna learn Back-End too. I'm always open to learn new and interesting things. So, let's go!
