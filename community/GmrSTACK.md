## My Projects

I have worked on several JavaScript projects, mainly through [DIO.ME](https://web.dio.me/). I am familiar with programming logic, Git, and GitHub. I am also studying Python and working with libraries like `python-telegram-bot` for creating Telegram bots.

Here are some of my projects:

* [JavaScript - DIO.ME](https://github.com/GmrSTACK/logica-de-programacao)
* [HTML - DIO.ME](https://github.com/GmrSTACK/HTML-project-basic)

That's all for now. I hope you enjoy them!

```c
int main() {
    int friend = 220;
    int otherFriend = 284;

    printf("Hey bro, It feels like you are my other half.");
    return 0;
}
