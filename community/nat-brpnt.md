## ✨ About Me 
Hi! I'm **Natalia** a QA Engineer from São Paulo.

I'm originally a Business Administration major but, as many other people, when the pandemic hit I decided to migrate to the *tech world*. When a good friend of mine introduced me to the QA career I thought I could finally get something good out of my bad luck *(you know when they say something works for 95% of the users? There's a BIG possibility I'll be part of the unlucky 5%)* and turn it into a career.

At my current job I use a lot of SQL and data validations daily and that's when I became interested in Data Science. So, you can currently find me at the [Bootcamp](https://www.dio.me/users/nataliabrpnt) taking the **Data Science** path!

  

On a more personal note I have two cats named Merry and Pippin (yes, they love second breakfasts ❤️)

I love watching the NFL *(Let's go, Giants!)*, discovering new coffee spots and everything that has ***paçoca*** on it.
