With over 10 years of experience in planning and budget analysis, I am currently the 
  Coordenador Geral de Sistemas de Informação de Planejamento at the Secretaria Nacional 
  de Planejamento/Min do Planejamento, where I lead the development and implementation of 
  information systems for the national planning and budgeting process. I am also a Scrum 
  Fundamentals Certified professional, and I apply agile methodologies to manage projects and teams efficiently and effectively. In addition, I have a passion for teaching and sharing my knowledge, and I have been a professor at the Universidade Federal da Paraíba for a year, where I teach computer science courses to undergraduate and graduate students. My core competencies include defining requirements, project planning, teaching, and problem-solving. My mission is to use my skills and expertise to improve the quality and transparency of public administration and governance in Brazil. I value collaboration, innovation, and social impact, 
and I seek to work with diverse and dynamic teams that share these values and goals.
