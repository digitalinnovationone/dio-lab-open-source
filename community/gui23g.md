# Guilherme Lopes de Carvalho

&ensp;Hey! My name is Guilherme Carvalho, but you might know me as BG from the YouTube channel Rookie Game Dev. I'm a Game Developer and a Software Engineering student at INTELI (Instituto de Tecnologia e Lideran√ßa).

&ensp;I deeply believe in the transformative power of technology and strive to share this message with everyone, just as technology has profoundly impacted my life.

&ensp;At INTELI, I engage in a Project-Based Learning (PBL) environment where I collaborate on projects with real companies, tackling real-world problems.
