Undergraduate student in Systems Analysis and Development and Information Security, with practical experience in IT security and infrastructure. I work on network and VPN configuration, Active Directory management, creation and management of virtual machines in VMware ESXi and cloud environments (Azure, Contabo, GCP), and system monitoring with Zabbix and Grafana.

My experience also includes ticket triage and documentation, incident investigation, implementation of ticketing tools, firewall installation, technical support, and script creation for Windows and Linux. I am also familiar with penetration testing (Pentest) and DNS and WAF (Cloudflare) configurations.

I am constantly updating myself with the latest technologies and methodologies in the cybersecurity market, always seeking to improve my skills and knowledge.
