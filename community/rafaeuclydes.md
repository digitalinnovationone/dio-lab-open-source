## 👨‍💻 About Me

💻 Career-changer currently studying Systems Analysis and Development. I’m focused on **front-end development**, with hands-on experience in **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React**. I build applications that prioritize usability and user experience, always aiming for clean and functional solutions.

🎓 I completed a **basic fullstack development bootcamp** at the **Instituto Atlântico**, where I deepened my knowledge of web development and programming best practices.

📊 In addition to programming, I’m also interested in **data analysis**, especially using **R**, exploring statistical and ecological concepts in academic and scientific projects.

✨ I’m always looking to grow as a developer—whether building modern web applications, creating intuitive interfaces, or learning new technologies to expand my skill set.
