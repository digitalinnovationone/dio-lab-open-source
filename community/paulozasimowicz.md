Results-driven professional with a background in Chemical Engineering and diverse internships. Proven expertise in project coordination, digital process optimization, and data reporting.

Well, let me tell you a bit about my journey so far. I completed my undergraduate studies in Chemical Engineering at the Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU) in December 2023. During my time at UFU, I was actively involved in two student groups, which allowed me to develop my leadership and teamwork skills.

After graduation, I decided to pursue a master's degree in Textile Engineering in Belgium, starting in September 2024. This decision aligns with my goal of expanding my knowledge and skills in engineering, particularly in the textile sector. However, my interests don't stop there.

I'm also eager to learn about data engineering and artificial intelligence. I believe that combining these areas with my background in chemical and textile engineering will not only expand my career opportunities but also enable me to contribute to innovative solutions in these fields. My goal is to leverage these diverse skills and knowledge to address complex challenges and make a meaningful impact in the industry.

Overall, I'm excited about the future and the opportunities that lie ahead. I'm committed to continuous learning and growth, and I'm confident that my multidisciplinary background will allow me to excel in a variety of roles in the engineering field.
