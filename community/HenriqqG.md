        <h2 style="color: cornflowerblue">About me</h2>
        Started my University life as a Computer Engineering student at the Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Goias (PUC GO) in 2017, completely in love with the area I chose, always seeking new areas of knowledge in order to improve my skills.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 2019, I got the opportunity to transfer to Universidade Federal de Goias (UFG), where I studied for 3 years and got to improve some of my skills, joining the Development Team at Memora Processos Inovadores S/A, first as an intern.
        <br>
        <br>        
        In 2022, i went back to Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Goias, as a Computer Science student, focused on graduating.
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently working, mainly as a Web Developer, since 2019 I had the opportunity to work with Flutter, in the development of the EON Mobile Application, available on Google Play and Apple Store, and several other Web Applications such as Fiscalização Inteligente Seletiva (FIS) and AutoReg, for tax auditors and Plataforma Digital de Processos (PDP).
        <br>
        <br>
        Looking forward to increase my experience in the development of web applications.
        Self-taught with ease of adaptation to new technologies, in any new experiences I will dedicate myself to the maximum.
