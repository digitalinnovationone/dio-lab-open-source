## About me
Hi, I'm a beginner fullstack developer and this is my journey in programming. I started programming in 2020 when I created some small powershell and batch scripts and fell in love with coding. Later, I enrolled in a software engineering college and today I'm exploring the world of development. Here is a description of my skills and projects for GitHub.

In college, I'm learning the basics of C, Java and C++, but I also studying other languages on my own. I enjoy working with open source projects where I can help others developers improve a project or even implement new features in the project. I already contribute with a few projects in GitHub and now I'm starting making some sketches for my own projects so I can making the right decisions and have a functional projects when I go to publish them.

I'm always eager to learn new things and improve my skills. I'm looking for opportunities to collaborate with other developers and contribute to open source projects. I'm also interested in learning more about development stuff and other languages to improve my skills. My goal is to become a fullstack developer.

**Currently I'm preparing to go 6º period in Software Engineer on University Estácio de Sá.**
