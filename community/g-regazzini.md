# g-regazzini
I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at UFABC, a journey that has fostered my multidisciplinary approach. My academic path led me to join Rockets Design team's electronics department early in college. The diversity of experiences has been my cornerstone.

I've had the privilege of interning at prominent organizations like Itau Unibanco, Redecard, and Amazon. This journey has allowed me to delve into analytics, program management, support, and coding for automation and problem-solving. These roles have honed my communication, writing, and adaptability skills. My independent and inquisitive nature drives me to rapidly acquire new knowledge.

As an AWS Data Engineer at Ipsense, I continue to push the boundaries, crafting efficient data pipelines within cloud infrastructure. By optimizing data processes, storage, and integration, I am proud to play a role in shaping data-driven strategies that fuel Ipsense's growth.
