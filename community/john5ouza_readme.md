## About Me

Hello, I'm [John](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john5ouza/), a Designer transitioning to software development! ðŸ‘»

With a background in visual design, I'm now focused on **web development** with **Java** and **Spring Boot**.

I'm seeking opportunities to **contribute to Open Source projects** in the future. Additionally, I have a strong interest in **making a difference in the lives of PWDs** (People with Disabilities) and am dedicating my studies to understanding and implementing **accessibility solutions** in this process.
