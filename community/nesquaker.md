# Introduction

Hey everyone,

I'm 22 years old and discovered my passion for programming a few years ago. Although my educational background is in a different field, I've been drawn to the world of coding and Linux, and I'm excited to be a part of this community.

### Background

I've been using Linux on and off for about 4 years now, and I've been consistently learning and exploring its capabilities. Recently, I decided to pursue my interest in programming and Linux more seriously, and I'm currently studying Git, Python, and other related technologies.
