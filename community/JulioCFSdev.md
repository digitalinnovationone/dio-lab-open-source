## About Me
Transitioning my career towards backend development, I'm now focusing on leveraging my skills in Java and Kotlin, particularly with Spring Boot, to develop robust and scalable server-side applications. My journey has taken me from game development to a passionate pursuit of backend technologies, where I aim to contribute to projects that make a difference.

I'm also exploring Angular to understand full-stack development better, aiming to bring comprehensive solutions from the server to the client side.
