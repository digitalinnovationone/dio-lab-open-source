# ⚓ Hi there, I am Cesar Nardy ⚓

 **Cruise Staff** at [MSC Cruises](https://www.msccruises.com/int), worked also as **Activities Manager** at [Pullmantur Cruises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullmantur_Cruises) and as **Guest Services Manager** at [Staycity Aparthotels](https://www.staycity.com/).

## 🏢 **Working Experiences**
I have been working for over 10 years in hospitality mainly on cruise ships. However, I found it was time to dive into new professional challenges and found the technology area really appealing to me.

## 💻 Goals
By my  studies at [DIO](https://www.dio.me/), I intend to specialize in some areas of technology in order to start my professional career and also aim to be a great professional in the market.
