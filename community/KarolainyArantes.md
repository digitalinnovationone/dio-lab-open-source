## Hello Word, i'm a student of Data science
I study every day to be a data scientist, I only talk about it, I just think about it, I live for it. I really love data more than anything.

## 🏆 professional experiences:
I currently work as a production manager, leading a team of 15 seamstresses and I love making clothes so much. I have been in charge of 2 teams and in the currently team all the seamstresses were trained by me from scratch, I appreciate people management and I always  want to work as a team.
