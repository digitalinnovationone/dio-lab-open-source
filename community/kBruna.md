# Hi there! I'm Bruna Kaori ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm currently a Systems Development student at FATEC-SP, expected to finish in 2027. Coming from a background in Graphic Arts and Computer Graphics, and I found myself wanting to learn more about technology. I fell in love with programming and problem-solving. There is still so much for me to learn, and although it's a lot, I'm really eager to continue. Nice to meet you!
