✨ Creating bugs since: 2024  

📚 I'm currently learning **Python** and **C**, focusing on logic, problem solving and solid programming fundamentals.

🎯 Goals:  
- Improve my coding skills every day  
- Turn theory into real projects  
- Build a strong portfolio over time  

🎲 Fun fact: I actually enjoy debugging (after the stress passes 😅)
