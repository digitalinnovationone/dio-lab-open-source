# Hi! I'm Larissa 💚
## System Analyst and Developer (in development)
I am currently enrolled in the second semester of Systems Analysis and Development at the Federal Technological University of Paraná (UTFPR-CP). Through this program, I have been able to acquire knowledge in the field of development, including programming languages such as C, Javascript (and consequently, HTML and CSS), and Python. Before that, I temporarily worked in the tourism industry, thanks to my fluency in English, basic level of Spanish, and communication skills. In addition to that, I am always seeking opportunities to learn, communicate, work in teams, challenge myself, and gain new experiences!
