### About me


Passionate Developer with a Flair for Innovation and Automation

Iâ€™m Bruno Freitas, a seasoned developer with a degree in Information Systems (2010) and over a decade of experience in the tech industry. Currently, I work at IBM on the AT&T account, one of the telecom industryâ€™s giants. My journey with IBM began in 2009 as a trainee, and after a brief hiatus, I rejoined in 2019.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in various technologies, including Windows, Linux, TSO Mainframe Environment, Java, COBOL, JCL, DB2, Python, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Excel Macros in Visual Basic for Applications. My passion lies in innovation and automating repetitive tasks. I thrive on building scripts and macros that streamline processes and enhance efficiency.

I believe in fostering a collaborative team environment and maintaining strong relationships with my colleagues. I enjoy exchanging experiences with senior team members to improve my skills and mentoring junior colleagues to help them grow. Teaching and sharing knowledge is something I find incredibly rewarding.

Recently, Iâ€™ve developed a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence. I think I can say that I rekindled a childhood passion, because I was fascinated by Artificial Intelligence in my kid and teenage days, mainly because of AI in science fiction. It excites me to see the fieldâ€™s development and expansion in recent years, pushing technology to new boundaries. Although I donâ€™t have professional experience in this field yet, Iâ€™ve been immersing myself in it through courses, reading, and videos. Itâ€™s a fascinating area that I am eager to explore further.

Outside of work, I enjoy simple pleasures like watching movies and series, playing video games, reading, studying, walking with my dog, and spending quality time with my family.

Feel free to connect with me if youâ€™d like to discuss technology, innovation, or potential collaborations. Iâ€™m always open to new opportunities and connections.
