HELLO GUYS
👋 Hi, I’m @CaioCaetanoo and graduated from Fatec Zona Sul in São Paulo. I learned to love development at Etec, where I had the chance to work on projects that allowed me to blend electronics and software development.
👀 I’m interested in POO, Web and Data analytics.
🌱 I’m currently learning POO Java/C#, SQL and HTML(CSS and JS).
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that allow me to improve my skills.
