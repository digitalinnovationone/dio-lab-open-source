### 🚀 About Me

🙋🏻‍♀️ Hello there! I'm Jessica, a dedicated tech enthusiast with a strong background in Information Technology. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems from the University of Pernambuco, where I participated in an exchange program at the University of Guelph in Canada. Additionally, I've completed several mini-courses in various development fields, enriching my expertise in the tech domain.

💻 Passionate about technology, especially in the realm of software development, I thrive on exploring new technologies and tackling complex challenges. Fluent in English, I bring to the table a solid skill set in PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Angular, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap. Additionally, I'm proficient in managing SQL Server, Oracle, and MySQL databases.

🎯 I'm driven by a commitment to excellence and thrive in dynamic environments where I can contribute my problem-solving skills and attention to detail. With a strong sense of responsibility and organization, I approach tasks with precision to ensure timely and high-quality deliverables.

🐶 Outside of coding, you'll often find me spending quality time with my dogs or immersed in investigative series. I enjoy the companionship of my furry friends and the thrill of unraveling mysteries on screen.

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn to explore potential collaborations or exciting opportunities!
