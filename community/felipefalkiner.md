My name is Felipe, but everyone calls me by my nickname Falk which is shorter for Falkiner, I currently live in São Paulo, Brazil and when I was born, my father bought his first computer, where I spent hours on Paint and playing games on Windows 3.1.

I also graduated in System Analysis and Development at FATEC-SP one of the best technology colleges in Brazil with the final paper “APIs efficiency in audiovisual productions”.

Speaking about my final paper, I’ve been working with esports since 2014, and in 2017 I joined the Brazilian [ESL](https://esl.com/) Studio where I was hired to act as a Broadcast Developer, creating solutions and software for live events, one of my first achievements was a Twitter Integration, where Social Media Team had a Dashboard to select Tweets using a specific hashtag and send them directly to the broadcast!
