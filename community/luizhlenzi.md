# LUIZHLENZI


Hello, I'm Luiz. I have a background in administration and I'm currently pursuing a Postgraduate degree in Management and Strategic Data Analysis. I've chosen to enroll in the Santander Data Science Bootcamp with Python to further expand and enhance my knowledge in the field of data analysis.

At this moment, I'm actively seeking opportunities that facilitate a career transition.
