##### About
Have you ever wondered how technology can transform lives and businesses, promoting inclusion, equity, and sustainability?

My journey began with an unwavering passion for technology and innovation. With a degree in Production Engineering, I started my career exploring the vast field of engineering and soon realized the transformative potential of technology. My initial experience as an E-commerce and CRM Coordinator provided me with a holistic view of the impact of technology on customer experience and operational efficiency.

Currently, I am a technology leader focused on delivering innovative and sustainable solutions. My mission is to lead diverse teams to promote digital transformation, always with a keen eye on inclusion and equity. I take pride in being a problem solver, capable of navigating complexities and finding solutions that drive continuous growth and collaboration.

In my position as Tech Hub Manager for Latin America, I lead a multifunctional team in the areas of AppDev, AppOps, Data, DevOps, Projects, and Operational Support. This experience allows me to ensure that our technological initiatives are always aligned with the company's strategic objectives, promoting an efficient and secure environment.

My aspiration is to continue leading significant changes through technology, contributing to a more inclusive and sustainable world. I am always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills in leadership, project management, and problem-solving in organizations that share these values.

If you share my passion for technological innovation, inclusion, and sustainability, let's talk! I am always open to discussing how we can collaborate to transform ideas into reality. Contact me directly here on LinkedIn. Let's transform the future together!
