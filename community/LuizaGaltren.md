# Hello World, I'm Luiza Santos ðŸ‘‹

After dedicating over 12 years to accounting, I'm embarking on an exciting new chapter. It has been my goal to explore every facet of the field. Now, I'm on a thrilling programming journey, a lifelong passion that's finally becoming a reality.

As a Computer Science student, I'm immersing myself in the foundations, starting with front-end development encompassing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My pursuit extends beyond coding, as I'm mastering logic and algorithms using Python and C.

With a solid foundation in intermediate English, I'm eager to tackle new challenges, pushing my boundaries in programming and beyond. Additionally, I've taken on the admirable task of conquering Dutch a language that's as challenging as it is beautiful. This epitomizes my steadfast commitment to growth and learning.

While I don't boast prior tech experience, my commitment and dedication are unparalleled. I'm driven to embrace every opportunity to learn, adapt, and excel. My journey isn't just about acquiring skills it's about evolving and embracing change with tenacity.
