## Hello there, I'm Victor.

Fullstack Software Engineer with +14 years of experience, specialized in Node.js (+4 years), React.js (+6 years), CI/CD (+4 years), AWS (+3 years) and Kubernetes (+4 years), with experience in the Information Technology, Education, Property Security and Transportation/Logistics industries.

Among the highlighted projects:

- Real-Time Incident Notification System: Developed with Node.js, React.js and Firebase Firestore, this system reduced the team's incident response time by 70% and improved problem resolution by 50%;
- Activity Tracking and Patrol Microservice (Nicbrain): Developed with Node.js, NestJS and MongoDB, to isolate this high-demand functionality, which generated excessive cloud costs. This optimization resulted in a 20% reduction in cloud costs, by reducing the processing power of the main Kubernetes cluster and ensuring scalability via a cluster dedicated to the microservice created;

My DevOps experience includes Docker and Kubernetes, with proficiency in AWS and GCP environments, and CI/CD mastered via GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Cloud Build and Bitrise. In addition, I am a proactive and innovative professional, with strong adaptability and problem-solving skills, always seeking the best solutions to complex challenges. My experience with Generative AI, including the use of tools such as OpenAI, allows me to explore new technological frontiers and innovative approaches.

- Technologies: React.js, Next.js, React Native, Redux, Javascript, Typescript, Jest, Node.js, NestJS, Python, Flask, OpenAI, JWT, Git, Docker and Kubernetes;
- Google Cloud: GKE, Cloud SQL and Cloud Build;
- AWS: EKS, RDS, S3, Api Gateway, Lambda, Redshift and Glue;
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Realtime Database and Firestore;
- CI/CD: Github Actions, Cloud Build, Gitlab CI and Bitrise;
