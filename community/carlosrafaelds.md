#### From a Brazilian Lawyer to a Data Engineer.

## A little bit about me...
Person with phisical disability. I'm in career transition. I currently work as a lawyer and assistant in a big health plan. In my routine as an assistant, I usually use excel to control activities and power BI to show the indicators to managers.My main goal is to become a data engineer and for that I take courses focused on the area of Data Science.I have a personal project that aims to use artificial intelligence to validate legal arguments in legal petitions, judicial decisions, appeals or requiriments to facilitate the daily life of legal professionals, big lawfirms or courts.
