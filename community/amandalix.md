I have a background in *Humanities and Planning*, which gave me a strong critical sense and people-oriented view. Somewhere along the way, I discovered data - and we‚Äôve been best friends ever since.

Currently, I work as a **Systems Analyst** at **Vivo (Telef√¥nica Brasil)**. My daily life includes creating dashboards with Power BI, building ETL processes, and helping teams make better decisions using data - all within agile environments.

Curious by nature, I‚Äôm pursuing an MBA in *Data Science & Analytics* at USP/ESALQ, where I'm diving deeper into predictive modeling, machine learning, and business intelligence.

## üöÄ What drives me
- Turning data into meaningful stories
- Creating smart, impactful solutions
- Collaborating across disciplines
- Lifelong learning (and sharing knowledge too!)
