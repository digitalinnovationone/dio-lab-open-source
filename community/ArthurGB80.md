## 


Hello! I'm currently going through an exciting career transition into the programming field. With a solid background in Structural Engineering, I have decided to explore my passion for technology and specialize in software development.

Currently, my focus is on enhancing my skills in backend development, using languages such as Java, Spring Boot, and Quarkus. I'm eager to learn about these technologies and apply them to create efficient and scalable solutions.

Although my journey in programming started recently, my previous experience in civil engineering, particularly in structural analysis, has provided me with a strong foundation in problem-solving, tackling complex challenges, and working in teams. These skills are transferable to the world of programming, where I am excited to apply them to innovative projects.

I am constantly seeking knowledge and staying updated on industry best practices and trends. Through courses, tutorials, and hands-on projects, I am building a solid understanding of object-oriented programming, software architecture, and agile development.

In addition to software development, I am also familiar with version control tools like Git and collaboration platforms like GitHub. I believe that collaboration and knowledge-sharing are essential for professional growth, and I look forward to contributing to the developer community.

If you are looking for a dedicated developer who is passionate about programming, I am ready to contribute to the success of your project. Let's work together to create innovative and impactful solutions!

Feel free to reach out to me through my contact information below:
