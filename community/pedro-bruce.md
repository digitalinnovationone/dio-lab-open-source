# Hey There!

My name is Pedro and I'm currently studying Computer Science at Universidade Estadual Paulista (Unesp). I'm also looking for my first job. I worked on some projects inside Unesp involving Web Design with Figma, CSS, HTML and JavaScript. You can also see my LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedro-bruce/).
