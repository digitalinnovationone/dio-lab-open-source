# Security Researcher

Security researcher with experience in research and development and cybersecurity engineering. Throughout my career, I have contributed to multiple information security projects, helping organizations strengthen their cybersecurity posture. I also actively hone my skills through hands-on labs and challenges on platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe, and participate in Bug Bounty programs.
