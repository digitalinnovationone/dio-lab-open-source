## Hello! My name is Davi Felipe.
I am in the final stages of completing my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I have created several apps using Python and KivyMD and have experience working with JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.

I have been studying React, React Native, Jetpack Compose, and Kotlin for mobile development. Recently, I have developed a strong interest in Flutter, which is currently occupying most of my free time.

In my spare time, I enjoy drawing pixel art characters for a community fighting game that I am developing using MUGEN.
