# Hi, I'm Jhonata! üëãüèΩüßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª


Back in 2021, I started my journey in the world of programming after a sudden interest in how websites were made. I started learning HTML, CSS, and was amazed by how much you could do with just a few lines of code.
Since then, I've been discovering new technologies and improving my skills. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems by the Federal Institute of Esp√≠rito Santo.
Nowadays, I'm trying to expose myself to new challenges and technologies, and always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. In my free time, I often play some games, listen to music, and watch tech related videos.
