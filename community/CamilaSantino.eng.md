# 👩🏾‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm Camila — a developer by curiosity and an artist by nature, based in Fortaleza, Brazil 🇧🇷.  
I'm passionate about art, comics, poetry, visual storytelling, and everything that reveals everyday life through new lenses. I also study languages: currently practicing English and French, and beginning German.

I build apps for fun — I enjoy turning ideas into interactive experiences. I test games, explore interfaces, and follow trends with a critical and creative eye. For me, coding is as expressive as writing or drawing. I learned to program through self-teaching, exploring documentation, tutorials, and experimental projects. I don’t always know the name of the language I’m using — but I know what I want to build, and I learn what’s needed to make it happen. I like testing ideas with code, even without following a formal structure — the goal is to create, understand, and evolve.

I'm interested in how AI can expand cultural experiences, storytelling, and human interaction. I believe languages — whether spoken or coded — are bridges between worlds. I see technology as a cultural tool, and I want to work on projects that bring both together, creating experiences that connect people, ideas, and perspectives.
