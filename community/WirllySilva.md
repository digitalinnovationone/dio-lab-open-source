# Hello, I'm Wirlly Silva

    I'm currently pursuing my degree in Software Engineering

    My journey in the field of technology began in February 2023, and I'm thoroughly enjoying every moment.

    I have knowledge in Java and JavaScript programming languages, as well as SQL database management.

    Additionally, I have some familiarity with HTML and CSS, but my focus has always been on back-end development.
