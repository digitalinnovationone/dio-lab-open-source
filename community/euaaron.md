![Hello There](https://i.giphy.com/xTiIzJSKB4l7xTouE8.webp)

I'm **Aaron Carneiro**, a fullstack developer from Brazil.

Before talking about myself, here are my contact links:

So... Who am I and how did I got in here?

Well, I started with tech when I was a teenager, by doing Minecraft mods with **Java** and Pokemon "hack ROMs" with LUA script.

During my journey I have done projects for **mobile**, **desktop** and **web**, both on **backend** and **frontend**, but I have to say that I'm more into the front-end side of the Force.

Before starting to learn IT I was a creative kid who loved to draw, paint and create things with clay or wires, and I like to keep practicing my creativity by doing **web design** on **Figma** and styling pages writing the **CSS** by hand or creating my own **design system** library.

> I have worked though with Bootstrap, Foundation and other public and private design systems and I know how to use and implement 'em if needed.

Now in 2025 I do have about 12 years of study in different tech areas, like development (web, Windows, Android, macOS and Linux), QA, DevOps, cloud, network, security, web design, AGILE and AI, but only around 4 years of working experience for companies like Thomson Reuters, Stefanini and Dell Technologies.

Also, I just finished everything from my first graduation and will be officially graduated at September 3rd, 2025.

Currently my main techs are **Node.js** and **React** both with **Typescript**, sometimes using **Next.js** others using **Vite**.

But I also have experience with all the techs and tools bellow and a couple more:
