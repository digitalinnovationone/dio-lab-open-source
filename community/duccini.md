### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Guilherme!

I'm a Software Engineer focusing on React.js and Next.js at the moment.

My first contact with code was at Electrical Engineering College. A few years later I started learning Web development.

I worked with PHP/WordPress for a few years and currently work 100% with JavaScript as a Freelancer.

As a Freelance Developer in many projects, I have to develop the Design and Backend of the projects, which gave me a good foundation in Node.js and Figma.
