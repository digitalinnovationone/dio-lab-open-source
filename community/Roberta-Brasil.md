# Roberta Brasil

I am passionate about learning and promoting new technologies. I graduated recently in Computer Science from the National College of Ireland with a 1st Class Honours (1.1).
In addition, I have over 10+ years of Digital Transformation experience, working in Telecom, Customer Service, and Marketing through a variety of business processes and products.
Currently, I keep improving my technical skills and developing new abilities such as problem-solving, technical writing, and Cross-functional Collaboration through Bootcamps and courses.
Finally, I am seeking an entry-level or Junior opportunity in Tech specifically in AI career, and Cloud Computing, which allows me to use my abilities focused on 
integrating user experience practices into Software development processes and collaborating on innovative and sustainable projects.
