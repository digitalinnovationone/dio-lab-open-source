### About me

Graduated in Physics from Rural Federal University of Pernambuco (UFRPE), researcher of Complex Systems applied to Epidemiological Models and studying postgraduate in Data Science at Advanced Recife Systems Center School (CESAR School). I work as a Physics teacher and am in a career transition to Data Science.

During university, I participated in SAE BRASIL AeroDesign, where I worked on the development of small aircraft in the aerodynamics and stability units. I also worked as a Physics and Robotics trainee at the EspaÃ§o CiÃªncia Museum in the development of robotic projects based on Arduino, Raspbarry Pi and LEGO Mindstorms, in addition to working for a time as an Astronomy trainee at the Alto da SÃ© Observatory, in Olinda, which is also a unit of the EspaÃ§o CiÃªncia Museum. In the last years of university, I entered the Scientific Initiation Program (PIC) to research Complex Systems and Statistical Physics,
in the investigation through computer simulations how structural properties of complex networks influence epidemic dynamics, seeking to understand the initial behavior of the COVID-19 pandemic through the public transport network in the Metropolitan Region of Recife â€“ PE (RMR).
