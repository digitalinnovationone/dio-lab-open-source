## Sobre mim
I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Catholic University of Brasilia, a postgraduate degree in Computer Forensics and Digital Forensics and in Information Technology Management. I've been working with digital products for web and mobile since 2009. During more than 15 years of experience in technology, I've collaborated with clients in the telecommunications area such as Vivo, Claro, TIM, Oi, among others, participating in integration projects between the systems of these companies. I acted as responsible for managing the performance and change process, based on the best practices suggested by ITIL. I was present in projects as a Java Full Stack developer. I have solid knowledge in strategic planning and information management.
