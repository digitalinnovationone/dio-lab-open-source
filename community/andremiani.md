# Andr√© Miani

##### Since 2016, I've worked exclusively on the development and evolution of VTEX Stores, with extensive experience in creation, maintenance and integration for various industries in Brazil and LATAM.

##### I also have certifications and training related to VTEX IO, VTEX Legacy and CMX Level 1 Candidate that validate my expertise and skills, not only technical but also my knowledge related to the fundamentals of e-commerce for large projects and that allow me to deliver high quality solutions, scalable and innovative.

##### I'm passionate about this whole universe and I'm always eager to learn new skills and tools.
