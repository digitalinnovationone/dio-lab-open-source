## 😸 About me:
- 🎓I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at Gran Faculdade (2025–2029), with a focus on backend and full stack development;
- 💼 My previous experience in finance helped me develop strong analytical skills, attention to business rules, and concern for system reliability;
- 🚀 I'm seeking my first formal opportunity as a developer, applying my technical foundation to real projects, focusing on REST APIs, integrations, automations, and coding best practices;
- 🧠 I'm driven by solving real problems with technology, reducing operational costs, eliminating rework, and creating systems that add business value.
