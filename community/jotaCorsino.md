In the future, I intend to formalize my training by starting a degree in systems analysis and development, as I believe it is important for a professional to be trained in their field. I currently study on my own through free courses on the internet and am also helped by family and friends who work in the area.

## About me
I've been a Graphic Designer for 8 years, I've always worked in agencies and I thought I would work with Design for the rest of my life, because I have an appreciation for the studies in the area, but I ended up not realizing myself in the area and slowly I lost interest, which led me to look for new areas of study.

I've always been a curious person, I like to try new things, since I was little I've always found it difficult to fit into a single area and I ended up becoming a "multidisciplinary enthusiast", which helps me a lot in the area of Design, which ends up requiring this at a certain point. But my desire changed after I started experimenting with HTML and CSS as an expansion of my skills as a Graphic Designer, because then I discovered the universe of Front-end, but I really fell in love with JavaScript, not necessarily the language itself but the programming logic, for me it was wonderful to practice the logic behind the codes, to create functions, methods and I'm still studying, this time POO with C# and I want to continue learning how to create entire systems.

I ended up discovering that I really like programming logic, I don't want to work with aesthetics anymore, I want to work writing code, solving problems that challenge me and that I enjoy seeing everything working as it should.

I want to be a back-end developer, more specifically a .Net developer.
