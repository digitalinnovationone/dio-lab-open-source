# Hello World!

I've been a sales manager for 15 years in real state and always had a strong connection with tech and new trends. Now I'm diving into the programming world, trying to make a career change that can use all my previos experience and soft skills. 

Also, i am a tech student at FGV, one of the most renowned educational institutions, to help me build this new path.

The goal is to be a back end developer soon, making it my full time job.
