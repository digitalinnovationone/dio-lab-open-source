# Vinicius Valentim Pereira

I'm a beginner back-end developer looking to improve my skills. I'm studying Computer Engineering at Universidade de Sorocaba (UNISO). My first contact with programming was during my teenage years in a game development class, where I learned block-based programming. 

Later, I was introduced to Python, and my overall exposure to technology deepened during my Mechatronics technical course, from which I graduated in 2021.

In my free time, I enjoy playing football and basketball, going to the gym, playing Valorant, and either playing or listening to music.
