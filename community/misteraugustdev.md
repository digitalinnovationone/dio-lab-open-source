# Hello, everyone!  
**My name is Augusto Luiz Melaré.**

I have been studying to be a videogame and multiplatform software developer since 2024. I have still not decided wether back-end or fullstack.
I was an English teacher until 2023. When I decided to change my career, I was certain I wanted to do something related to videogame creation. So I decided to study coding.
I tried Python first just to feel what it is to work with programming languages. Afterwards, I chose Unity as my first game engine and started studying C#.
As I study this language, I not only think about videogames I want to develop, but also I though of some apps.
Besides becoming a videogame and software developer, I also want to learn pixel art. That will help me a lot when I create my first games all by myself before having a crew.
I was born and currently live in the state of São Paulo, Brazil.

**My Languages:**

| Language            | Level  |
| :------------------:|:------:|
| Portuguese (Brazil) | Native |
| English             | C1     |
| Spanish             | B1     |
| German              | A2     |


**My current goals:**

+ Start an IT graduation course;
+ Learn more C# and then .NET, ASP.NET and Blazor;
+ Study SQL;
+ Finish Unity's free 2D game developer course;
+ Improve my Spanish and German.


**Now, some other fun facts about me:**
+ I am a goth boy and love make-up and tattoos;
+ Sometimes I make my own clothes;
+ I had plenty of good time playing Minecraft back then; today I often play Just Dance.
