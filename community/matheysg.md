##### I am an Information Technology Management student, currently transitioning careers, with a strong interest in Software Quality Assurance (QA).
I am specializing in software testing with a focus on automation, studying tools such as Selenium, Cypress, and Playwright, as well as programming logic, Java, and JavaScript.
I have experience working night shifts and am used to managing my time efficiently, even during long shifts.
I am currently seeking opportunities as a QA intern or junior, where I can apply my knowledge and continue growing in the tech field.
I am dedicated, self-taught, and always eager to learn more to become a well-rounded professional in software testing and quality assurance.
