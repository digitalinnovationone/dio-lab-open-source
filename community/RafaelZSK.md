# Hello Word! ðŸ‘‹ #

My name is Rafael. Here, I will talk about myself, my skills, and my aspirations.

## About Me ðŸ”Š ##

I'm 21 years old and studying production engineering in the last year at Curitiba - PR, Brazil.

At the moment, I'm working with Lean Manufacturing in the industrial field, applying concepts of 5S, TPM, OEE, and developing Kaizens focused on continuous improvement.

I'm starting a career transition, moving into the programming area, which is why I'm taking the course at [DIO](https://www.dio.me/).

## My Skills ðŸ“Š ##

I'm studying to become a developer. This aspiration began when I studied Programming Language at university. I developed a project in Python to [calculate a second-degree function](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_jckVZw0Dk9VWF6ClH81lVXT9vNJgq4K?usp=sharing) and another to [convert numeric bases](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13RyvaW3VohdoKLnWX6RSlfvgmLqr-a-Z?usp=sharing) in Google Colab.
