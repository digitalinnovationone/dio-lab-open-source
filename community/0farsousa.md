# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, IÂ´m Francisco Anderson

## :wink: About me
- I'm a great system developer . 
- I'm looking for opportunities and collaboration in projects related to Web Java Programming.
- Iâ€™m currently learning Spring and VueJS Frameworks.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a professional project as I've only been on academic projects. 

## :man_technologist: About my journey in programming
- Because I'm very curious, I've been experimenting with different frameworks to understand them and find a pattern for how they work. 
- That way, in the backend programming, I could try Django (Python), Express (JavaScript), Laravel (PHP) and Spring (Java). 
- And, in frontend programming, I was able to try out React and Vue.
- But now I'm focusing on Spring and Vue.
