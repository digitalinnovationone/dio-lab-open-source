Hi, I’m Lucas, I’m 24 years old and I’ve been working as a software developer for about 2 years. Most of my experience is with React Native, Node.js, JavaScript and mobile development, but I’m always curious to explore new technologies. I enjoy learning, improving my skills, and working on projects where I can grow while building useful and impactful solutions.
