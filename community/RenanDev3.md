## 🚀 Expertise

<p>
With a strong foundation in both back-end and front-end development, I've honed my skills in crafting robust and efficient web applications. On the back-end, I've collaborated extensively on projects using Python FastAPI, implementing the onion architecture and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. I've not only applied business logic but also established seamless connections with databases to handle various HTTP requests, including "GET," "POST," "PATCH," and "DELETE." My expertise extends to the implementation of the "Unit of Work" design pattern, ensuring data integrity and consistency. To maintain code quality, I've meticulously created unit and integration tests for critical functions, prioritizing reliability and stability.
</p>
<p>
On the front-end, I've contributed to developing user-friendly interfaces that seamlessly interact with back-end services via RESTful APIs. My toolkit includes HTML, Tailwind CSS, and ReactJS with TypeScript, allowing me to build dynamic and responsive user experiences. Notably, I've designed and implemented forms using the "formik" library for data insertion, incorporating business logic and real-time updates through the "react-query" library. Additionally, I've crafted intuitive modals for data updates and deletions, complete with validation checks and efficient API communication using the "axios" library. My proficiency extends to user authentication and token management, enhancing security by validating tokens and ensuring seamless redirection to login pages when needed.
</p>
<p>
 Lastly, my agile methodology experience shines through my active participation in Scrum teams, engaging in key activities like sprint planning, daily scrum, grooming, sprint reviews, and retrospectives, all facilitated through Azure DevOps.
