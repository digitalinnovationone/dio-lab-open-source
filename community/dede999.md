# ★ Meet André Luiz Abdalla Silveira ★

I'm experienced developer looking forward to learn new technologies, and new ways to look at the same code. There aren't too many concluded work in this account, and that's because the most impactful projects I've been envolved had clients which would not be happy if I made their codebase open. By enrolling on [**DIO**](https://web.dio.me/), in the other hand, I seek to display projects and learnings throughout this journey.

I'm a curious soul in many different aspects, and I was given the opportunity to work with  smaller to bigger clients. The stacks being used varied from Ruby on Rails to React and a some Golang, too.

Before we move on with such enthusiastic presentation, let me appreciate the work made on **StackEdit** website, and star it if you enjoy it (and you'll probably do).
