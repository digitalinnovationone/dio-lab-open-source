## DIO
Currently, i am on Back-end with Randstad(.NET) because i want to become a Back-End Developer.

## About
I study in Warsaw(3rd semester of Computer Engineering) and so far, it's being great, however with DIO, it's being easy because I put my hands-on! my First bootcamp here was C# and it really helped me a lot because one week later i had object-oriented programming exam and it helped me to practice and master new concepts.
