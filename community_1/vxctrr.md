Hi,Â niceÂ toÂ meetÂ youÂ ðŸ˜Š.

MyÂ nameÂ isÂ Victor Gabriel. I`m 24 years old.Â 

I've worked in the IT area for 2 years, mainly with HelpDesk support, and in August 2023 I started my degree in systems analysis and development.
I am currently studying Java and some Cloud technologies such as AWS and Azure through my efforts in addition to C# in my graduation.
I have a initial knowledge with PostGreSQL, SQL Server, Python, HTML, CSS, PHP. But the language that i'm focusing is JAVA.

I have experience with some types of technologies, but the focus is in **Infrastructure and **Network**, like Cisco Switches, HP/Aruba Switches, Fortinet Firewalls, and some protocols like DNS, DHCP, NAT, etc..
