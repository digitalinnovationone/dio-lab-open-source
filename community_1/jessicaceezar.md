# JÃ©ssica Cezar da Silva

Hello everyone!
Welcome to my Github and to my world. Here i'ts where everything happens. 
I made this profile to share with the world my college and personal projects.

I've started with the techonoly area when I was still 15 years old. At that time, I could get some experiences in the area, like in volunteering projects as a teaching assistant  (working with JAVA programming language) and in a internship as a technical support and an instructor of basic computing and software development. In this experience I worked with some languages as JAVA, Delphi, Visual Basic, CSS, Html, MySQL and PHP. During 9 years after the conclusion of my technical course, I dedicated myself to explore a different area: Fashion Design. 
I won't lie, this process was very important to me to develop better as a person and a professional. But, during all the college, I felt like my heart was divided for the two areas so I decided to finish my Fashion Design college to, after that, dedicate myself to a second college in the technology area. And here I am, trying to do my best everyday to learn more and more. 

## I love to share all that I learn, so if you want to contact me, please send me an invite:
