# A. Reznor

I am proud to hold a Master's degree in Comparative Literature Studies from the renowned Faculty of Philosophy, Languages and Human Sciences (FFLCH) at the University of São Paulo (USP), completed in 2023. This accomplishment follows an earlier Master's in Management and Development of Professional Education obtained at Centro Paula Souza (CEETEPS) in 2017. My research and academic pursuits focus on the exploration of learning elements, production of teaching content, game development, literary analysis, and innovations in the area of technology.

I am deeply fascinated by the development of interactive games and their multifaceted applications in educational contexts. For a comprehensive view of my research pursuits and publications, please visit my [Lattes profile](https://goo.gl/qd2oWR).

In addition to my academic pursuits, I thrive in creative spaces as **A. Reznor** — a writer, composer, and public speaker. I am the imaginative force behind the **"Valley of Secrets"** book series and have a notable presence in over 30 anthologies.

## Video Game Development

My creative expertise also extends to video game development, where I have crafted bilingual scripts, documentation, and storytelling that complement game design. My contributions have enriched a diverse array of titles, including:

- **"Sleeping Dragon"** (Vermillion Studio): A finalist at SBGames 2019 for Best Technology and Best Game, a ProAC 2019 game funding grant winner, and featured at the Art in Series academic event in 2021.
- **"Bedtime Fright"** (REVStudio): A finalist at SBGames 2018 for Best Design and Best Game, a BIG 2019 finalist for Best Brazilian Game, and part of the Lugar de Jogo 2021 project showcased by Sesc Digital.
- **"Skydome"** (Kinship Studio): A MOBA - Tower Defense hybrid, published by Gamigo US Inc. in 2021.
