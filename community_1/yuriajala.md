2017 - 2019
    - Conducted academic research in the Signal & Image Processing Group in the Sao Carlos School of Electrical Engineering in collaboration with the Group of Magnetic Resonance, Spectroscopy and Magnetism in the Sao Carlos Institute of Physics
    - Developed a model-based machine learning algorithm to better estimate the percentage of fat in the human liver [Thesis (in English)](https://teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/18/18152/tde-01102018-083519/publico/Yuri.pdf)
    - CAPES (Coordination of Improvement of Higher Level Personnel) fully‐funded scholarship grantee
    - Relevant coursework: 

Master’s degree in medical data & image processing. By analyzing MRI images, I developed a model-based machine learning algorithm to better estimate the percentage of fat in the human liver. [Thesis (in English)](https://teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/18/18152/tde-01102018-083519/publico/Yuri.pdf).

- UFMS, Brazil / Western Michigan University, USA — *B.Sc.*
2008 - 2014
Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering. Awarded a scholarship to study Electrical Engineering at Western Michigan University for one year. During that time I was part of the WMU’s [Solar Racing Car team](https://www.wmich.edu/sunseeker/) developing cooling systems.
