# Flora Martins

Skilled in PHP, WordPress, Jquery, SASS, and Front-end Development in general. My time studying Graphic Design at UFRJ (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) and the two years at Grama.cc gave me the ability to develop a quick, pixel-perfect and mobile-first front-end code paying good attention to details and coding best practices.

It seems crazy looking back at 10th grade me that actually managed to fail HTML classes at school because “she was gonna be a designer and didn’t have to learn coding”. It’s fair that I would think that, I liked to draw, paint pretty things and was just a teen, how was I supposed to know that’s not what design was really all about?

Then we skip a couple years ahead. All grown up me in graphic design school, working at a brand, editing photos, doing posters and getting frustrated. The turning point when I saw a friend coding and realized the beauty behind what they were doing: turning a bunch of letters into something pretty and animated and alive.

Now that I'm thinking about it, I wonder if that’s what brought me to screen writing: the idea of watching letters turn into pretty things. Maybe that’s what makes me embroid, paint with watercolor and ultimately, code front-end: watching random things turn into pretty things and pretty things take shape and come to be, in their own unique way. Or maybe I’m just crazy, who knows? I’ll ask my psychologist and come back to you on that.
