# Hi, Luiz Furtado here! Glad to meet you! ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About Me
Hey there! I'm your go-to person for all things **C# and .NET backend development**. Lately, I've been having a blast building cool stuff for collaboration, automation, and digitalization using Microsoft's Power Platform. I love creating apps that work with **SharePoint** and **Teams**, and I use fun tools like **Power Apps**, **Power Automate**, and even some custom **JavaScript code**.

Oh, and did I mention I know my way around **Dynamics 365 CRM**? I'm also pretty good with **Governance** and **ALM best practices** for Power Platform solutions.

Fancy a chat? Just hit me up on my socials and let's get the conversation started!
