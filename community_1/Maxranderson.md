### Hello folks! I'm Maxranderson but call me Max ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer passionate about creating products, no matter the language I use.
It could be a Backend software, Frontend, it doesn't matter, I just want to be involved with the creation process.
Well, we know that we can't do everything so my  main skill is focused on Backend with Scala using Functional Programming but I'm trying to migrate back to Node.js and Java.
