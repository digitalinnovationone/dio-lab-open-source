## Front-End Developer
My professional journey began with the technical course in Information Systems, in 2003, at the age of 18. My first job was as an intern, in 2005. I worked on developing websites and systems for the internet using the object-oriented PHP language in conjunction with the SQL language in MySQL databases. I designed and developed databases and coded the data management system intranet and website for several clients. In 2006, I completed the course. I was hired as a systems programmer at the end of my internship. At this point, I already had a good understanding of Front-End, having worked on so many projects inserting PHP and SQL into HTML codes using CSS3 and Javascript, AJAX and jQuery functionalities. I learned all of that by reading the code and observing its use, manipulating it with programming. I decided to take a risk, to change career. I applied for a job at another company and was chosen. I took on the new position of Front-End developer. And in this role I worked in several companies over the years. In 2012, I went on sabbatical. And then I discovered the science of Law, for which I ended up developing appreciation and curiosity. In 2014, I started studying at UCPel on the Law course. I obtained my bachelor’s degree in law in 2020, in middle the COVID-19 pandemic. There were no board exams, so it was not possible to advance in the area. In 2023, I decided to return to IT. I started this process by taking free courses in the languages and technologies I was already used to, such as HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. To further solidify my knowledge and curriculum, in March 2024 I started the Systems Analysis and Development course at UNISINOS, which I am currently dedicated to. Due to the big changes in the area, I discovered that I need to learn about many more technologies to actually be able to work in the area again. At the moment, I am looking for an internship position, as a university student, so that I can get back into the market.
