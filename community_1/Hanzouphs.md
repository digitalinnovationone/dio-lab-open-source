## **About me**
Passionate about development.

My goal is to develop software and systems as solutions for
the most diverse needs of everyday life.

To achieve this goal, my commitment has been to improve and develop skills such as:

* Good sense of organization;
* Good problem solving skills;
* Good learning ability;
* Good team spirit;
* Good communication.

This last one was personally a challenge, since I was a more shy person.
But I made a commitment to improve and have been exposing myself to situations and circumstances to overcome shyness, although challenging, the process has been rewarding!

I am proactive, focused and persistent, I am always looking to improve and prepare myself for the most diverse opportunities that life offers in the form of "luck".

*After all, for me, luck is the result of the meeting between preparation and opportunity...*
