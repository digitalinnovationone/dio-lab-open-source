### Hello, my name is Iury Mikael

- Computer Science major
- High level of english
- Always trying to improve my skills in backend development.

I get very excited about the technologies I work with and make studying a recreational activity. I always try to do my best to deliver any project. I am creative and contribute ideas whenever possible. Teamwork is a practice with which I identify a lot, both giving support and receiving.

My goal is to become a specialist in backend development & engineering. I am very focused and determined.
