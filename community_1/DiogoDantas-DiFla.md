# Hi there, my name is Diogo Dantas ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

I am a self-taught person who likes to study both theoretical and practical content about Full Stack development, so I did a graduate course in Information Systems and a postgraduate course in Java, as well as several online extension courses.

I worked as a Full Stack developer for 3 years, creating sites and adding databases to them with PHP and MySQL until I was fired from the company where I worked thanks to the crisis of the Dilma Rousseff Government, so I made my living as a freelance programmer until I passed the 2019 public tender for Educator Agent in a municipal school, but I started working in this new job in 2022 because of the Coronavirus pandemic. 

Today I help children and teenagers to become successful men and women in a future with infinite possibilities, in addition to developing my soft skills, such as teamwork, for example. In my free time, I develop my hard skills, focusing on Full Stack development, as well as playing games om my Xbox.
