<h1 align="center">A little of my story!</h1>

<p>It all started in the heart of the army, where I had experiences that challenged my limits and shaped my character. Between intense training and challenging operations, and of course, some secret stories that I would love to share, but shh... military secret!
<br>
After my military journey, I joined the night surveillance area, sometimes working armed. Feeling like Batman (without the Batmobile, unfortunately).
The responsibility was high, but the feeling of being the guardian of the shadows was priceless. However, fate had something surprising in store for me.
  
<h1 align="center">The key turn!</h1>

And then, because my mind was focused on helping, a key turn happened. A friend of mine invited me to join the team in his super busy parking lot. More than 5 thousand cars passed through there every month, and to this day they have computers with an entry and exit registration system and various technological facilities. Models, times, agreements - they had everything recorded by the computer!
That's when the burst of inspiration happened. My mind was buzzing with ideas to optimize the system, like a true Tony Stark of parking lots. But there was one small problem: I didn't know anything about programming. What did I do? I decided to go on YouTube, of course!
And that's how I got to know a little more about this world, oh so many things... And without being any superhero, I signed up for a Software Engineering college. My journey was beginning, and I had no idea what was in store for me.
It was at that moment that my dream began to take shape and expand, almost like an app in its first beta version - but full of potential. With new tools at my disposal, my imagination took off like a space rocket. I realized that there was a new world in front of me and I was getting to know it.

<h1 align="center">A plan for professional happiness</h1>

Today 04/10/23, I have 1 year and 6 months of college and I'm still an apprentice, but I have a plan! And it's as exciting as a science fiction movie. I combined my military experiences, nights of surveillance and passion for technology by taking separate courses, to shape my skills, I want to establish myself first as a front-end developer, to create innovative solutions that make the world more efficient, and of course, more fun. And for the near future? Create incredible applications that revolutionize the way many people interact with the digital world. Finally, as a life goal, in the future, I will establish myself as a visionary of the metaverse, where creativity and innovation have no limits.
After all, as I've already learned, with persistence everything is possible for those who believe! And I believe, with all my heart! ðŸš€ðŸ’¡
