## Who am I?

My name is Mateus Villarroel! I've had my bachelor studies in Psychology and am currently doing my Masters in Neuroengineering, at the International Institute of Neurosciences - Edmond and Lily Safra.

## What am I interested in?

Right now I'm focused in the neuroscience field, more specifically in the learning and memory area. This experience has drawn my attention to the powers of data science and to how you can manage huge databases and extract meaningful information from them.

## What are my next steps?

Even though right now I'm all about behavior-related data, I'm improving my set of skills and plan on entering the job market combining the technical know-how I'm acquiring and the critical and goal-oriented thinking I developed through my academic history. 

## How to get in touch?

I'll be more than happy to know you and exchange knowledge and experience!
