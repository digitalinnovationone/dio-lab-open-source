üöÄ Technology enthusiast and front-end development student ready to make an impact!

üéì My name is Breno Hideki Umehara, and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Information Systems at Anhembi Morumbi University. I'm deeply focused on honing my skills in front-end development. My passion for technology has led me to delve into languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, where I strive to specialize, as evidenced by my certifications in Responsive Web Design.

üíº With a solid professional background in finance, I've gained valuable skills that complement my tech education. Over a year at Mirai Im√≥veis, I served as a Finance Assistant, managing cash flow, issuing invoices, handling accounts payable and receivable, and preparing management reports. Additionally, I've honed my proficiency in tools like Excel, and Google Sheets for data analysis and process optimization.

üåê Fluent in English, Spanish, and with a basic understanding of Japanese, I'm always eager to expand my horizons and take on new challenges. I'm excited to explore opportunities that allow me to apply my passion for technology and make meaningful contributions to innovative projects.

üîç If you're seeking a dedicated professional, passionate about technology, and ready to add value to your team, feel free to connect with me!
