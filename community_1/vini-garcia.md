# About me

Firstly, I would like to say that I have been working as a lawyer for 10 years, however, this was never my dream profession. I then decided to study programming because I am a software development enthusiast.
Throughout my training journey, I gained valuable experience in software development, demonstrating a consistent ability to apply good programming practices.
My ability to learn quickly is a distinctive feature that has driven me to explore and assimilate new practices, technologies and programming languages efficiently.
I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team, applying my passion for programming and my constant desire for professional improvement.
I am confident that my ability to meet technical requirements and my already mature mindset would be a valuable addition to your team.
