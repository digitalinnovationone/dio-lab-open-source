Self-taught in English and programming languages. Fueled by curiosity, dedication and a passion for continuous learning and understandly in algorithms I can learn any programming language. Through self-directed study and hands-on projects, I've cultivated proficiency in C# and C++, and honed my skills in game development frameworks such as Unity and Unreal Engine. As a hobby, I am always working on a side project during my free time.

Simultaneously, my self-study in English has been an ongoing endeavor to achieve fluency and proficiency. Through a combination of immersive experiences and regular practice, I have cultivated strong communication skills in both written and spoken English. This proficiency allows me to effectively collaborate with diverse teams, communicate complex ideas, and engage in cross-cultural interactions with confidence.


What sets me apart is not only my technical expertise but also my creativity and adaptability. My self-taught background has instilled in me a sense of resilience, my game development background improved my Problem solving skill. I approach every endeavor with enthusiasm, determination, and a commitment to continuous improvement.
