## Career
I'm a **civil engineer** since 2014, passionate about creating solutions for everyday life. So, it's the reason I'm migrating to development back-end, currently learning to code in **Java**. 

I have been mentored by [Simone](https://github.com/a-pinheira) about planning and beggining of my developer career and I'm learning in a Bootcamp Dio, among others searchs on YouTube, tech sites and Java documentation.
