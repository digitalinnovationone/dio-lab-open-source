👋 Hi, I’m @CassioSilverpelt, Cassio for short.

👀 I’m interested in Video Games, Art in general, every animal you can think of (except for parasites) and learning new things about almost everything I can get my hands on.

🌱 I’m studying to become a programmer but still haven't quite decided what I want to focus in. I'm actually a bit inclined to work in Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Fullstack or Security. A wide spread, I know. That is to say you can split my head with an axe and put each piece somewhere and I'll probably be happy as long as I'm learning and using said knowledge. I'm currently studying Java Cloud Native and LLMs on the DIO platform and on the 4th semester in Analysis and Development of Systems, in Fatec Zona Leste, an University in São Paulo.

Ever since I was small I had a growing interest in computers, mainly developing small functions softwares and also art of any kind (2D, 3D, animation). It wasn't until much later that I had the opportunity to begin developing things on my own. I've dabbled in javascript and C# but mostly for small projects or little games to practice. Never too big and life always got in the way. Now that I am married and attained a lot of focus, partialy with my wife's help, I intend to make this into a career. 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything of interest or importance, really. From softwares, AI projects or games.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him. I'm all for any minorities as long as you're respectful to everyone.

⚡ Fun fact: I used to own multiple ant farms and tarantulas in the past. I'm naturally curious and very talkative given the chance, but I tend to keep to myself.
