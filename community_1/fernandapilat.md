## Hi Guys! My name is Pilat ðŸ’«

Brazilian data analyst with a background in business administration. Currently, I'm pursuing an MBA in data science and also taking part in the Santander Becas data science bootcamp.

I have over six years of experience working in startups, where I analyzed processes and collaborated with the technology team to develop new features aimed at improving operational efficiency. I created operational productivity metrics and built control panels using Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint. I also have experience writing SQL queries, coding in Python, and developing Dashboards.

In my current courses, I'm studying statistics, Python, Tableau, and Power BI. You can check out my portfolio on [GitHub](https://github.com/fernandapilat).

Furthermore, I am a Co-organizer of the data track at the WomakersCode NGO, which provides free training for women to work in STEM fields. In the past, I also volunteered at the Somando Mais AÃ§Ãµes NGO, using my data knowledge to create impactful visualizations and attract more volunteers with targeted content.
