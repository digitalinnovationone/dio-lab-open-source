# About me

Hi, im Daniel Montresor. I have been studying programming for 1 months, focusing on the Python language, particularly in backend development. Currently, I am participating in Vivo's bootcamp, where I am honing my skills and knowledge. My goal is to continually professionalize in this field, always seeking new opportunities for learning and growth in the technology sector. ðŸ˜Ž
