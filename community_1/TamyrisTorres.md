## About Me &#x1F642;

You already know a little about the developer, now let's find out more about Tamyris.

I have a degree in Law, but I chose to change my field in 2021. I love rock music to listen to and watch a beautiful film or anime. ðŸ˜œ	

I love punctuality and responsibility, but a coffee â˜• break is always welcome.

One skill I acquired while practicing law was prioritizing excellent delivery, being on time, and meeting the client's needs.
