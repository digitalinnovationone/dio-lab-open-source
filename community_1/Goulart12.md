### Greetings, friends ðŸ‘‹

<p>I am a 24-year-old back-end developer, graduated in Computer Science, currently living in Volta Redonda, RJ. I have solid experience in technologies such as C#, .NET, and SQL and NoSQL databases. My work includes building efficient APIs and system integration, as well as using tools like Redis, RabbitMQ, Docker, AWS, and Google Cloud.
I also have knowledge in front-end development using JavaScript, TypeScript, and Vue.js. In addition to my technical skills, I value the importance of soft skills in the workplace. I am an effective communicator, work well in teams, and have a knack for problem-solving, which allows me to collaborate productively with colleagues from different areas.
I am always looking to enhance my skills and contribute to challenging projects that promote innovation and efficiency. I am open to new opportunities that allow me to grow and collaborate in dynamic, learning-oriented environments.</p>
