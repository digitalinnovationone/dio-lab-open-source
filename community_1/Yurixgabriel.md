  <h1>Hello visitor, welcome to my territory!</h1>
</div>
 
Let me introduce myself. My name is Yuri Gabriel, a technology enthusiast and one of the **"alphas"** who lead [918 Error](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGBOSg8c_fLLpQVvrkYyAsQ), as well as the host of this place.

~~And no, it's not a 404 error, hahaha!~~ I'm talking about [error 918](https://www.instagram.com/918.error/), a brand that my friend and I created to bring together the things we both love, such as games, programming, endless laughter, ... and other ideas that come up. 🎮💻🤣

918 operates like a technological mafia, where family is everything and technology is our weapon! We aim to provide unique entertainment, and well... we're like two jesters together, you know what I mean, right? Haha!
