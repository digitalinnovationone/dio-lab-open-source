ðŸš€ Contributing to the Project ðŸš€
Hey there! Iâ€™m Breno Cordeiro de Souza Lima, a 27-year-old backend developer. Super excited to have you here and canâ€™t wait to see what awesome stuff youâ€™ll bring to this project!

ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Iâ€™m all about backend magicâ€”crafting solid server-side solutions and making code work like a charm. When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m probably diving into the latest tech trends, or just enjoying a good book. Iâ€™m always up for a chat about code or tech!
