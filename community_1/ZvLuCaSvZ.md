### üíº Professional Summary.

Early in my career, I learned to manage complex workflows, tight deadlines, and high-impact responsibilities. Working in Payroll and HR operations for over 90 companies taught me more than just compliance and numbers ‚Äî it taught me discipline, precision, and how well-designed systems can drastically improve everyday processes.

That‚Äôs exactly what led me to Software Engineering.

Inspired by how technology can optimize work, I decided to switch careers and start building the solutions I used to rely on. I'm now entering the 4th semester of my Software Engineering degree and actively focusing on Python development, especially in the fields of back-end, data analysis, and machine learning.
