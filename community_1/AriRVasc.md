# Hello World, my name is Ariadne Rodrigues! 

Currently, I am a Software Engineering student and have completed a Full Stack Web Development course. I have knowledge in Java and Python for data analysis, gained through a project offered by Serasa Experian, where I also interned as a data engineer for 1 year and 9 months. I am currently looking to re-enter the job market and am seeking a position in the development area. 

On a personal note, I am a pet mom to two pets, love exploring nature-connected places, reading books, watching series, and cooking for my family. I am passionate about new technologies and always eager to learn more.
