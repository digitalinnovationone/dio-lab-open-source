## Hello there!

I'm Rafael Rodrigues and I work making a difference through data strategies! I've been working in IT for over 10 years, 5 years as a data analyst and 1 year as a planning and project manager in the public service. I seek to implement the best principles and methodologies on the market to leverage business, increase earnings and add value to institutions.

Currently, as an analytics consultant, I provide clients with end-to-end BI projects, involving data extraction from different sources (API's, RDBMS, etc.), its transformation and loading with technologies ranging from Google Cloud Platform to open source, based on best practices and guaranteeing success through structured solutions and projects of excellence.
I emphasize:

- Project tools and best practices (Poetry, MKdocs, Pytest, Pydantic) 
- Python and SQL for extracting, transforming and loading data (ETL) from various sources and APIs;
- Version control with Git; 
- Use of the cloud, especially GCP; 
- Excel and Google Sheets;
- BI tools, especially Power BI, Qlik Sense and Metabase;
- Advanced English;
