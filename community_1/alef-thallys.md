## Welcome! 

I'm [Alef Thallys](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alef-thallys/), a self-taught back-end developer from Brazil, SÃ£o Paulo.

I started my journey in 2022 with front-end, after one year and three months I decide to delve into back-end with [PHP](https://www.php.net/).
Within two months, I began learning [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). 

**Seeking New Challenges**: When I found comfort with Laravel, I sensed the need to push myself further.
So, I started learning [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/whatis_java.html). By leaving my comfort zone, I intend to expand my skills more and more.
