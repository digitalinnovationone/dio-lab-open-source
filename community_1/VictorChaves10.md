# Hi, I'm Victor! :D
         


### About me

My first contact with programming was in late 2021 when I took the web programming course. It was in this course that I mastered HTML5 and CSS3 languages. Currently, I am studying backend using the C# programming language and the .NET framework for desktop and web applications. My objective is to become a full stack developer 🎯.

- 💼 Technical Support Analyst at Atos

- 👨‍💻 Studying at the 5th .NET Academy by Atos in partnership with University Franciscana.
