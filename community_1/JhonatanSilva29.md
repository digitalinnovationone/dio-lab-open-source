##  👨🏽‍💻 About me:
| I'm Jhonatan, and i just started to learn about Data Analysis. What really interested me about this career were the technical skills needed to be able to do good analysis and solve business problems. However as i progressed in my studies i find that a data analyst job is not just about be good at SQL, Tableau, Excel and other softwares, but is also to be capable of ask the right questions, understand the problems presented in all possible details, avoid data bias,etc. 

## 📔What i am studying:
| Currently i am studying data analysis through the Google's Data analyst course on the Coursera Course platform. Youtube and DIO have been my main sources of learning, and are the two platforms i use the most to seacrch for free workshops and bootcamps to increase my knowledge about data.
