## üöÄ About me
I worked as a technical salesman in an auto parts company from 2011 to 2014. In 2014, I transitioned to the secure transportation of valuables, where I gained my first experience in production analysis as a data analyst. As an Operational Controller, I provided planners and management with comprehensive data on transport and internal logistics (Takttime, JIT) and developed key performance indicators that significantly reduced costs. I also initiated the company‚Äôs first shift planning program.

Later, I became a Logistics Analyst at CEVA, a third-party provider for Bosch Brazil, where I implemented warehouse ramp-up processes, developed KPIs for supply chain and internal logistics, and created tools to manage logistics workflows. After five months, Bosch hired me as a Logistics Planner, where I led projects to optimize ABC curves, balance picking and packing, and support automation initiatives across Bosch Latin America.

Since leaving Brazil in 2022, I have taken on non-qualified roles in construction, cleaning, and driving while remaining committed to my previous career path. I have also improved my proficiency in Italian, English, and German, and am currently studying these languages. Additionally, I am deepening my knowledge in Machine Learning and Automation using Python, R, and mathematics.

Currently, I am transitioning to a career in full-stack programming. I am focusing on learning new technologies and programming languages, and I bring experience in automating processes, ranging from low complexity (VBA) to high complexity (Automation Anywhere, Push Bot/Catalytic).
