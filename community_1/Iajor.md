# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

## About me:
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Hi, i'm AndrÃ©. Born and raised in Brazil, where i work and study each day to improve my abilities and knowlegde in creativity, communication, critical thinking, problem solving, teamwork, programmimg, data analysis, foreign language proficiency, software development, and more. Currently i'm  in college and studying in my free time with on-line courses and tutorials, also with bootcamps, about the most popular and used technologies in the market, trying to get a systemic view of it all, but I can't deny my interests in Data Science, IoT, Cybersecurity and Cloud. I'm looking to collaborate on small projects, while doing some of my own, so i can practice what i've learned and of course get to meet new people to talk about this ever changing world of technology.
