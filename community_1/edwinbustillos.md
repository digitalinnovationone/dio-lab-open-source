### About
In the IT area, I had different challenges and opportunities, which provided skills like Full-Stack. I acquired substantial experience in leading the strategy and development of large scalable applications. I have extensive knowledge of Node, ReactJS and Python with visual computing. I'm an advocate for DevSecOps practices, embedding security at every stage of the development lifecycle. I have GitLab certification and also work with GitHub and BitBucket, I have the ability to configure and optimize CI/CD pipelines, automate tests and perform in-depth security analysis.

I have a background in software architecture, including patterns like MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), Clean Architecture and Design Patterns. I use these principles to create a solid and scalable foundation for my projects, ensuring modular, maintainable and testable code.

I've worked as a Tech Lead, leading development teams and coordinating projects. I have experience in team management, collaborating with team members, setting goals, assigning tasks and ensuring project delivery within deadlines and quality standards.
