# ðŸ‘‹ Hello World / Luciano Gasques

I'm 16 years old and I have the dream of becoming a Web Developer, I live in the countryside of SP, and since I was a child, I spend hours in front of the computer. With a journey of more than 3 years dedicating myself to electronic sports, I now dedicate myself daily to evolve and specialize more and more in Front-End development.
<br>
 I am looking for challenges and opportunities that allow me to grow and improve my skills in the Front-End universe.
