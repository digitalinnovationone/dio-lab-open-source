<b>About Me</b>
<div style = "text-align: justify"> I'm a passionate learning enthusiast and I have been studying the industry of technology and aiming to change career paths. My journey in the world of code began when I  finished my master's in a completely different field. This background actually brought me to study and comprehend the tecnologies that revolve around us in order to find more ethical ways to using it. I know the road is long to achieve this goal, but since then, I've been dedicated to expanding my knowledge, trying to solve real-world problems, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible through code.</div>
