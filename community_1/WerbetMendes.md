### About 
<i>
<br />
  
> Hello! 
  
> I've worked with a lot of different things in my life: English teacher; marketing manager; insurance broker; travel agent and... after many years looking for something that could really give me pleasure and pay the bills, I simply looked at something I was already doing, often unconsciously, but that was always there: programming.
  
> First, as most people normally do, I studied the frontend with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I studied design, with Figma, Photoshop and Illustrator. Then, I went to the backend with PHP and SQL. In the infrastructure part, I took three Microsoft Azure certifications. And now, I'm dedicating myself to learning Java and Angular.
Always studying.
