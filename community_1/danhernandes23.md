# My way in the universe of progamtion

Hello, my name is Danilo Hernandes and i 21 years old!
 
 - I started in the progamation universe in january 2022, when i entered in the university USCS studying system analysis an developments. I only managed to finish one semester in this university why i didn´t have time to study and work same time.

 - I fell in love with the world of programming and decided to enroll in a distance learning college for the same course.where I am still studying today.

 - I felt that college alone wouldn't be able to train me and make me a good developer, so that's why I signed up for this Dio bootcamp in search of more knowledge and opportunities in the area
