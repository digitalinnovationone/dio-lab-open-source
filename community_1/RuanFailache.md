# Hello there, I'm Ruan üëãüèº

I'm a Software Developer with experience in React and Flutter. My last job was at a Fin Tech where I developed a mobile application from scratch with Flutter and Bloc. That job helped me get out of my little box and learn new things about clean code and architecture, scalability, performance, etc. Since then, I tried to challenge myself to continue to explore and pursue new challenges and knowledge.

## About me

- I started studying programming in 2018, my first contact was at the University in the Computer Engineering course
- I dropped out of my Computer Engineering course to focus on my career as a Developer
- I attended the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at Driven Education from July 2021 to February 2022
- I've been studying systems analysis and development at Descomplica since April 2022

## What can I do?

- Develop Front End applications with Next, React, Typescript, Redux, React Query, CSS in JS, and TailwindCSS
- Develop Back End api with Express, Nest, Typescript, Prisma, Mongo, and Docker
- Develop Mobile applications with Flutter, Bloc, GetX, and Firebase
- Create unit, integration, and e2e tests for my applications using a TDD approach

## What am I doing now?

- Studying more about <strong>Micro Front End</strong>
- Studying more about <strong>Unit</strong> and <strong>Integration Test</strong>
- Studying more about <strong>Clean Architecture</strong> applied in Front End
- Studying more about <strong>Flutter's advanced topics</strong>
- Every day, I solve a question from LeetCode or CodeWars to develop my ability to solve complex code problem

## Talk with me or suggest an amazing project, I'm open to new ideas!
