# üå± Fernanda Tomita

Future Front-end Developer from S√£o Paulo, Brazil, graduating in **Analysis and Systems Development**. My first contact with programing was in a bootcamp where I was able to learn and practice Front-end with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript. I continued to study these and other topics, and then I decided to apply for the graduation course. I'm very excited to continue learning and improving my skills, and enjoying every oportunity to learn new things.
I'm passionate about nature, technology, music, dancing, reading, and my family and friends.
