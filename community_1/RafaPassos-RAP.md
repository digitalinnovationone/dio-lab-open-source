## My name is Rafael (with f)ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in NSK
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit Learn | SQL
  
  What I love most is diving into data: cleaning and wrangling messy datasets, building models and algorithms, and extracting insights using best practices in code, statistics, and engineering. I thrive on transforming raw data into meaningful visuals and strategic decisionsâ€”plus Iâ€™m always sharpening my skills in Python, R, SQL, machine learning, and security to keep it all robust and fresh.
