### 👋 Hey there!

I'm Caio, originally from a small town in Brazil — the kind of place where studying abroad was a distant dream. But I’m a dreamer who believes in action. I saved up, made sacrifices, and finally moved to Ireland to pursue a new path in tech.

I started out in mechanical engineering, designing everything from infrastructure projects to solving… well, cemetery overcrowding (yep, that was a real thing!). I had to learn fast, adapt, and lead — even as the only mechanical engineer on the team.

Then came the pandemic. Schools were scrambling, and I had the chance to teach kids how to code. I loved it. So much that I created YouTube lessons to help them keep learning remotely. That moment flipped a switch for me: I realized software development was my future.

Now I’m studying Computing at NCI and building the kind of career I used to only dream about. I’m looking for a company where I can grow, collaborate, and contribute to real-world projects that matter.
