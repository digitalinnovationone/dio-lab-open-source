## ü™º hello and welcome!

I am a 22 year old self-taught front-end developer currently studying software development.

A lover of arts and technology with a great passion for learning new skills, my first contact with this world was through making animations with JavaScript at 14.

My greatest hobbies include finding different ways of exploring new areas, trough books and movies, online courses and material or sharing interests with other people. I find it to be a good path for expanding my knowledge on multiple subjects, like drawing, language learning, and of course, technology and programming languages.
