<h2 align="left">About me</h2>



👋 Hi, I'm Gabriella Fontana



I'm transitioning into tech after several years working in fast-paced, problem-solving environments.  

I'm currently focused on learning web development and building practical projects to grow my portfolio.



\### 🌱 What I'm learning

\- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  

\- Git and GitHub  

\- Python  

\- React (coming soon!)



\### 💻 Projects

Here are a few of the projects I'm working on or planning to build:

\- 🚀 Random McDonald's Order Generator (fun project idea)

\- 📊 Data visualizations using Python

\- 📝 DIO Bootcamp projects



\### 📚 Background

I previously worked in airport operations and customer service, where I developed skills like:

\- Problem solving under pressure  

\- Teamwork and communication  

\- Organization and process flow  



These experiences now help me approach coding with clarity and persistence.
