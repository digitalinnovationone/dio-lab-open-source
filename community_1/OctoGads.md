## About me

I am a computer science professor who wants to improve and learn new technologies for discussion with my students. I have experience with the C, C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript programming languages and frameworks such as Spring Boot and react. I teach courses on object-oriented programming, web programming, Software Architecture, and others. I create this GitHub account only for the activities of programming courses.
