### The inner me

ðŸŒ„ I'm all about family, nature and cats (meow)! My main goal in life is to be healthy, live until I'm about 100 years-old and have a great (reaaaly great) balance between carreer and personnal life.

ðŸ“š I'm also a lifelong learning student who is always eager to learn something new everyday, thanks to my very curious brain.
