My name is **Átila Rodrigues**, and I'm currently studying **Computer Science** at **Federal Rural University of Pernambuco (UFRPE)** and working at **PickCells** as a **Software Engineer**.

I'm a fullstack developer with experience in ReactJS and NodeJS using TypeScript.

My journey with technology began at the Miguel Batista State Technical School, where I studied systems development as a technician. I've been passionate about programming and problem solving ever since.

I am skilled at working with others, able to communicate effectively, and practical when it comes to assessing my abilities and what I can accomplish.
