## 🧑‍💻 About me
Undergraduate student at UFRPE, majoring in Information Systems.
I was still in high school when I was first introduced to the world of coding by my cousins. My first programming language was **Python**, and since then I've worked with **Java**, **JavaScript**, **Flask**, **React**, and **PostgreSQL**.

I'm deeply passionate about technology — ever since I got my first video game, a PlayStation 2, as a kid.

Some of my hobbies include listening to music, playing games, watching movies and series, playing soccer, and working out.
