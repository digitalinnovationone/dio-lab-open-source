## Interests and abilities
I'm about to graduate in physics at Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), I'm interested in topics like biophysics, theorical physics and computational physics. Other part of me is interested in image editing and illustrations, using softwares like <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/adobe%20photoshop-%2331A8FF.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=adobe%20photoshop&logoColor=white" /> and <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/adobe%20illustrator-%23FF9A00.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=adobe%20illustrator&logoColor=black" />. 

## About programming
Well, as a physics undergraduate student I need to use softwares to study physical models through numerical methods, since the beginning of the graduation. And, that's why I leanerd the programming language R, initially to analyze covid data. Besides, I had contact with ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-000?style=for-the-badge&logo=python) as well, and I'm interested in learning more ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-000?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5) ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-000?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=264CE4) and  ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-000?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript)  too!
