Self-taught technology student, currently completing the Wex program on the DIO platform.
My skills include **JavaScript, Python, Azure Cloud, Git and GitHub, DotNet, and Java.**
I began my studies in pursuit of knowledge in the field, with my ultimate goal being to enter the CLOUD field as a CLOUD architect. I am using the Wex program as a launchpad to build a solid knowledge foundation for the future.
