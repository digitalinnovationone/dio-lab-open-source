### ðŸ’» A little about me!
Iâ€™m passionate about technology and its endless possibilities, diving headfirst into the world of web development, especially front-end! When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me enjoying music or gaming because, after all, fun fuels creativity! And when my mind needs a break, I grab my pencils and start drawing to relax and let my ideas flow. Always keeping an eye on the latest tech trends, Iâ€™m on a constant journey to learn, innovate, and expand my horizons!
