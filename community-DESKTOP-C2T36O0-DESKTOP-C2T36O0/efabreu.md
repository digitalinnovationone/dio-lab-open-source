##### Name:

# Eduardo Abreu
I'm a student of systems analysis and development at FIAP since 1/2023, but my path in developing softwares started in 2021 when I`ve learned basics of c++ to make a simple work schedule application for windows. In this little journey I've really enjoyed programming and saw that a had a potential to make some difference. I've worked the past 10 years in electrical engineering and maintenance as a team leader, but now I think I'm ready to look for a job developing softwares and a change of career.
