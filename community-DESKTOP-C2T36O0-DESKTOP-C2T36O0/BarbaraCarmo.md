# Bárbara Carmo  :wave:

Hi! My name is Bárbara, I'm an **iOS developer**.

## About Me

I'm a passionate developer specializing in iOS Swift, with about two years of professional experience, I've had the opportunity to work on various challenging projects, ranging from iOS applications to web development with React JS.

### Professional Experience

During my time as an intern at Compass UOL, I was responsible for developing and maintaining iOS applications using the ViewCode approach. I actively participated in projects that elevated the rating of applications on the App Store and contributed to the success of the team.

### Education

My academic background includes a technical degree as an IT Technician from SENAI and a Computer Science Bachelor degree in progress at PUC Minas. This solid foundation has equipped me with the skills and knowledge needed to tackle complex software development challenges.

### Certifications and Courses

In addition to my academic education, I continuously seek to enhance my skills through courses and certifications. I have completed remote courses focusing on Swift, SwiftUI, React JS, and cloud development practices.

I'm excited to share my projects and collaborate with other developers here on GitHub. Feel free to explore my repository and reach out to me for discussions or collaborations!
