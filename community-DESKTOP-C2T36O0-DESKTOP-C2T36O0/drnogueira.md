## Hi there, I'm Diego Nogueira ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
I'm Diego Nogueira, a tech enthusiast passionate about exploring various aspects of technology. I'm 30 years old and have been diving into the tech world since 2020. Originally, I pursued a professional degree in Design and Technologies for mobile applications, where I gained proficiency in prototyping with Figma, UI/UX design, and Android development. However, my true passion lies in web development, where I've worked extensively with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as frameworks like Bootstrap, React, React Native, Angular, and Vue.js. I've also acquired knowledge of both relational and non-relational databases, API usage, and other web development tools to ensure responsiveness, security, and performance.

As a curious and self-driven individual, I've explored various online courses to expand my knowledge, delving into languages such as Python, Java, TypeScript, and exploring different frameworks. Currently, I'm pursuing a degree while having worked for two years with low-code platforms, where I developed applications and solutions using the Power Platform. I enjoy understanding the intricacies of technology, learning about languages, processes, performance, and keeping up with articles on innovation.

Currently, I'm in the process of organizing my portfolio, which is why I don't have any public contributions at the moment.
