### About Me

I am currently the owner of a bar, a business I have been successfully running for over ten years. Managing the business end-to-end has sparked a deep interest in how data, technology, and business can be integrated to enhance product management. This experience also led me to explore Data Science related technologies

More details about my professional experience and academic background can be found on my LinkedIn profile.
