## About me
Hey there! I'm Thiago, 22, graduate in Graphic Design/Animation through ESPM! I'm a lover of fantasy, board games, and TTRPGs!

I have worked in a game studio in the past, albeit in the art department, and my interest in the field is what led me to DIO. I'm eager to learn more alongside all of you great  people!
