# Gabriel Rodrigues de Oliveira
## About me
My name is Gabriel Rodrigues, I am a Computer Science student currently in my 5th semester. I have a strong interest in the field of technology and have been dedicating myself to learning and acquiring new skills. I am working hard to demonstrate my commitment and dedication to creating quality programs, websites, and related projects. At the moment, I am focused on Java, but I have also studied the C, JavaScript, and Python programming languages, and I have basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.

My goal is to work in backend development, which is why I am concentrating on Java. I am capable of building CRUD applications, deploying them to the cloud, and managing databases. I am continuously improving to become a specialist in this language.

Feel free to take a look, leave a comment, or share any suggestions you might have.
