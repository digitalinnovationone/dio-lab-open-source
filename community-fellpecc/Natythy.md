#  Nathaly Silva

I'm a Data Analyst born in 2001 who lives at SÃ£o Paulo estate. I started my studies in data in 2022 when I was recovering from depression. A friend suggested to study in this area since he is a Data Engineer.

I love both programming and social/historical studies, such combination helps me to understand the data I'm analyzing through the social context when it's needed.

Currently, I'm working in a local tv broadcast and studying "BI and Data Analytics" at college.
