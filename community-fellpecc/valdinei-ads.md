# Valdinei Almeida


## üí´ About Me:

Hello!!!

My name is Valdinei, I have a degree in Software Analysis and Development, and I have been working as a developer for approximately 9 years.

For backend, I have worked with PHP, Java, and .Net with C#. Currently, I work with C# on the backend and Razor on the frontend, but I have been studying frameworks like Angular and ReactJS.

For frontend, I have used pure HTML and JavaScript, as well as technologies related to Java (JSP and JSF) and .Net (Razor).

I have also been studying a bit about Cloud.

My goal is to become an elite IT professional with knowledge that spans from choosing the technologies used, through cloud infrastructure management, to system development on both the backend and frontend, and ends with their monitoring.
