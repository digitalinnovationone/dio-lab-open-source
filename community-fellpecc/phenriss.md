## ðŸ‘¤ About me
 Hello! My name is Paulo Silva, and I am a beginner web developer who is passionate about creating innovative and effective solutions. With basic knowledge of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, I am eager to apply my skills to challenging projects and learn from hands-on experience.

In addition, I am currently learning Python, which will allow me to expand my skills in software development and data analysis.

I am motivated to create technology that makes a difference in people's lives. I am looking for opportunities to collaborate with talented teams and learn from experienced professionals.

If you are looking for an entry-level developer with passion and dedication, I am available.
