## ‚òï Hi i'm Pietro Leite, greetings üëã
I'm a data science student and I started programming because I've always liked robots, so I chose to specialize in an area where I could follow this path.
Being one developing an AI, a machine learning algorithm, or perhaps one day creating an algorithm for a physical robot, I always try to do my best and improve more every day.
