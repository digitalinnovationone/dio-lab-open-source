<h2>Technologies and Skills</h2>
I have knowledge of software engineering techniques and experience, at different levels, in a series of technologies acquired in academic, personal and work projects, seeking to become a generalist and independent professional when it comes to project management and software development, although I like areas that involve Back-end and low level more.

<h3>1. OS</h3>
<br>

![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&logoColor=black)
![Windows](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-0078D6?style=for-the-badge&logo=windows&logoColor=white)

<p>I have a good time of experience with these OS systems, suficietly to make more advanced tasks with its, the Windows in comomly use around my life and actualy with my work. Linux is my main system and where I have the most knowledge, having tried many distributions.</p>
<p>PS: I love terminal</p>

<h3>2. Languages, IDEs and Frameworks</h3>
<br>

![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white)
[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/GTK+-green.svg)](https://shields.io/)

<p>C is like the Latin of programming languages, it was the basis for most popular programming languages. When I directed my efforts towards its study, I could see an increase in the ease of understanding of any other programming language, for these reasons I acquired a great passion and respect for it.</p>
<p>Using it in conjunction with Glade, GTK+ and MySql, I built an appointment scheduling system for a psychology clinic in my sixth semester at university. Due to the lower abstraction layer of the language it was challenging, but it allowed me to evolve a lot.</p>

<br>

![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)
![Qt](https://img.shields.io/badge/Qt-%23217346.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Qt&logoColor=white)

<p>I arrived at C++ as a result of C, it is currently my favorite language because of its greater abstraction layer, with a huge amount of resources but at the same time maintaining characteristics that allow you to work on the low level.
</p>
<p>Learning the Qt framework was the result of my search for a tool that would allow me to put into practice my knowledge of the language, being able to develop more complete applications with GUIs and relational databases. I'm currently developing my TCC using C++, Qt and PostgreSQL.</p>

<br>

![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white)
![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)
![Javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=black)
![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-777BB4?style=for-the-badge&logo=php&logoColor=white)
![Bootstrap](https://img.shields.io/badge/bootstrap-%23563D7C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=bootstrap&logoColor=white)

<p>PHP was one of the languages I had the most contact with, through it I learned the concepts of web application development, it was the first language I started in programming.</p>
<p>Using PHP together with HTML, CSS, Javascript and PostgreSQL, two projects were developed at the university, in the third and fifth semesters.</p>

<br>

![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white)
![NetBeans IDE](https://img.shields.io/badge/NetBeansIDE-1B6AC6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=apache-netbeans-ide&logoColor=white)

<p>My biggest contact with Java was in the development of desktop applications using NetBeans and MySQL, through which it was possible to learn the principles of object orientation and have a better understanding of UML modeling practices.</p>
<p>In the seventh semester, a system was developed to store and process a series of data extracted from a questionnaire applied to a group of people, with the aim of facilitating the assessment of professionals in the area of nutrition.</p>

[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/VISUALBASIC-6-blue.svg)](https://shields.io/)

<p>VB6, together with SQL Server, is used in the company where I currently work. I work in the development sector and my main role is to maintain and develop new functionalities for a legacy system that works in meat processing companies, providing support to customers in resolving bugs and complying with industry regulations. </p>
<p>I have already implemented integrations with REST APIs, integration with functionalities involving tax documents, credit card machines, generation of invoices, generation of tax documents, reports, product labels, inventory management and movements for specific functionalities to meet customers' business rules. </p>
<p>Developed documentation of the internal framework used by the company that covers both the Front-end and Back-end of the system</p>
<p>I can say that it already extracts a lot from a legacy language and systems, including several modern features and integrations with new technologies.</p>
<p>Despite the simplicity of the language, the great demand for customizations, customer support and the size and lack of documentation of the system and database make the work challenging.</p>

<br>

![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-43853D?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)

<p>The contact with NodeJs came through work as well, opting for its use in the system migration (VB6). Its initial use comes from the need to develop some APIs to cover some deficiencies that the system has.</p>

<br>

![Shell Script](https://img.shields.io/badge/shell_script-%23121011.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=gnu-bash&logoColor=white)

<p>The study of Shell Bash was a consequence of linux, studying the system in depth I came across the need for its knowledge, mainly for configurations and the creation of automation routines for the operating system.</p>

<br>

![Fortran](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fortran-%23734F96.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=fortran&logoColor=white)
[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/ASSEMBLY-NASM-blue.svg)](https://shields.io/)

<p>My knowledge is basic, but I started to study Assembly Nasm in order to have more contact with low level. I have a strong belief that low level knowledge is essential to understand many computer programming concepts, through it we have the basis of how everything works, being a differential for a programmer, even if his performance is at the high level.</p>
<p>Fortran was also a part of my curiosity for the study of less abstract languages, being one of the first high level programming languages, it was a recent learning and at a basic level.</p>

<h3>3. Databases</h3>
<br>

![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-00000F?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)
![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-316192?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)
![SQL Server](https://img.shields.io/badge/Microsoft_SQL_Server-CC2927?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-sql-server&logoColor=white)
![SQLITE](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQLite-07405E?style=for-the-badge&logo=sqlite&logoColor=white)

<p>I have experience in these databases in the use of projects at the university and also at work, with PostgreSQL and SQL Server being the databases with which I had the most contact. The use of SQL Server has been constant.</p>
<p>I have a good level of general knowledge and familiarity with relational databases, my work experience dealing daily with an ERP system using Sql Server, developing queries for different types of reports, system functionalities, maintenance routines in client databases have familiarized me With the various features of relational databases such as functions, stored procedures, triggers, cursors, index optimization and structures that involve programming in databases (T-SQL), I also carried out integrations with other databases such as Oracle.</p>

<h3>4.Other Tools</h3>
<br>

![Apache](https://img.shields.io/badge/apache-%23D42029.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=apache&logoColor=white)
![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/git-%23F05033.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=white)

<p>The contact with Apache took place through the development of web applications, which make it necessary to know the configurations of this server.

</p>
<p>The practice in using Git came through personal projects and work, I was responsible for its implementation and management of the company's repositories using the Gitflow model.</p>
