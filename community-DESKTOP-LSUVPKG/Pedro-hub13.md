### About 
<i>
<br />

I'm Pedro, a driven Data Analyst fueled by nearly four years of unwavering passion for my profession. My journey in the field of data has been one of continuous growth and dedication to mastering the discipline. As I approach the completion of my computer science degree, I find myself equipped with a sharpened logical mind, a vital tool for dissecting and interpreting complex data sets.

In my toolkit, I use powerful instruments: Python and its libraries and APIs, allowing me to navigate the vast territories of Big Data; Power BI and LookerStudio, my preferred platforms for creating visually stunning and informative dashboards; and SQL, my trusted companion for querying extensive databases. However, my expertise transcends mere technical proficiency.

I pride myself on my ability to transform raw data into compelling narratives, enriching presentations that resonate with directors and coordinators of client companies. With each project, I not only analyze data but also shape the insights that drive decision-making, positioning myself as an indispensable asset in the field of data-driven business strategy.
