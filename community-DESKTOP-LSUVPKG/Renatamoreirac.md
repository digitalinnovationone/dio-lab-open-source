## Renata

I began my career as a quality intern, but my passion for technology guided me towards the IT field. During this transition, I was involved from the ground up in the creation of end-to-end hospital management indicators. My contribution spanned from requirements gathering to building intelligent visuals, utilizing skills in ETL and data modeling.

My journey is a constant quest to unlock the potential of data. With a results-oriented approach, I'm always eager to tackle new challenges and discover innovative ways to translate information into tangible value. I'm excited to connect with like-minded peers to share knowledge and explore the limitless possibilities of data together
