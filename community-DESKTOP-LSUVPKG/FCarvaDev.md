Programming Enthusiast with **Pawn** & Mapper **_SA-MP_**.

## **About me**:

I've worked in various different fields throughout my life, from being a Pizza Maker in a Pizzeria, a Partner in a Automotive Aesthetics Company, to an Animal Caretaker on a Farm in the Rio's Mountainous Region. I've always had a predisposition and ease of learning in what captures my attention, and today, especially, I'm seeking new horizons and challenges in the Technological world of Programming and Systems Development.

## **A little bit more about me**:

I enjoy listening to music - especially Rock and Roll ok? - I like FPS games, and I love to watch a good movie. As a hobby, I develop simple systems to the biggest _**Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - Multiplayer**_ server of a friend.
