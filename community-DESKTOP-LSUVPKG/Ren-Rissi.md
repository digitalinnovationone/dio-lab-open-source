# Ren-Rissi
Hello! I am Renato, a computational physicist by the University of São Paulo - São Carlos Institute of Physics. Currrently working at [LaraiaTech](https://www.laraiatech.com/) as a Development and Innovation Analyst.

Because of the university I started to like all sort of things related to data, so now I am seeking to build a carrer on the data field starting by exploring data engeneering, data analysis and data science.
